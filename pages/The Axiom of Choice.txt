In 1904 Ernst Zermelo formulated the Axiom of Choice (abbreviated as
AC throughout this article) in terms of what he called
coverings (Zermelo 1904).  He starts with an arbitrary set
\(M\) and uses the symbol \(M'\) to denote an
arbitrary nonempty subset of \(M\), the collection of which he
denotes by M.  He continues:
The last sentence of this quotation—which asserts, in effect,
that coverings always exist for the collection of nonempty subsets of
any (nonempty) set—is Zermelo’s first formulation of
the Axiom of 
 Choice[1].
 This is now usually stated in terms of choice functions:
here a choice function on a collection \(\sH\)
  of nonempty sets is a map \(f\) with domain 
 \(\sH\)
  such that \(f(X) \in X\) for every \(X \in \sH\). 
As a very simple example, let \(\sH\)
be the collection of nonempty subsets of \(\{0, 1\}\), i.e., 
\(\sH = \{\{0\}, \{1\}, \{0,1\}\}\). Then 
\(\sH\) has the two distinct choice functions
\(f_{1}\) and \(f_{2}\) given by:
  A more interesting example of a choice function is provided by
taking \(\sH\)
to be the set of (unordered) pairs of real numbers and the function
to be that assigning to each pair its least element. A different choice
function is obtained by assigning to each pair its greatest
element. Clearly many more choice functions on
\(\sH\) can be defined.
  Stated in terms of choice functions, Zermelo’s first formulation of
AC reads:
AC1: 
Any collection of nonempty sets has a choice function.
AC1 can be reformulated in terms of indexed
or variable sets. An indexed collection of sets
 \(\sA = \{A_{i}: i \in I\}\)
 may be conceived as a variable set, to wit, as a set
varying over the index set \(I\). Each
\(A_{i}\) is then the “value” of the
variable set \(\sA\)
at stage \(i\). A choice function on
\(\sA\) is a map \(f: I \rightarrow \bigcup_{i\in I} A_{i}\) such that 
\(f(i) \in A_{i}\) for all \(i\in I\).  A choice function on
\(\sA\) is thus a “choice” of an element of the variable set
\(\sA\) at each stage; in other words, a choice function on
\(\sA\) is a variable element of \(\sA\). 
AC1 is then equivalent to the assertion
AC2: 
 Any indexed collection of  sets has a choice function.
Informally speaking, AC2 amounts to the assertion
that a variable set with an element at each stage has a variable
element.
AC1 can also be reformulated in terms of
relations, viz.
AC3: 
 For any relation \(R\) between sets \(A\), \(B\),
  In other words, every relation contains a function having the same
domain.
Finally AC3  is easily shown to be equivalent
(in the usual set theories) 
 to:[2]
AC4: 
 Any surjective function has a right inverse.
In a 1908 paper Zermelo introduced a modified form of AC. Let
us call a transversal (or choice set) for a family
of sets \(\sH\) any subset 
\(T \subseteq \bigcup \sH\)
 for which each intersection \(T \cap X\) for
\(X \in \sH\)
has exactly one element.  As a very simple example, let 
\(\sH = \{\{0\}, \{1\}, \{2, 3\}\}\). Then 
\(\sH\)
has the two transversals \(\{0, 1, 2\}\) and \(\{0, 1, 3\}\). 
A more substantial example is afforded  by letting
\(\sH\) be the collection of all lines in the Euclidean plane parallel to the
\(x\)-axis. Then the set \(T\) of points on the \(y\)-axis is a
transversal for \(\sH\).
Stated in terms of transversals, then, Zermelo’s second (1908)
formulation of AC amounts to the assertion that any family of
mutually disjoint nonempty sets has a
 transversal.[3]
 Zermelo asserts that “the purely objective character” of
this principle “is immediately evident.” In making this
assertion Zermelo meant to emphasize the fact that in this form the
principle makes no appeal to the possibility of making
“choices”. It may also be that Zermelo had the following
“combinatorial” justification of the principle in
mind. Given a family \(\sH\) of mutually disjoint nonempty sets, call
a subset \(S \subseteq \bigcup \sH\) a selector for \(\sH\)
if \(S\cap X \ne \varnothing\) for all \(X \in \sH\). Clearly
selectors for \(\sH\) exist; \(\bigcup \sH\) itself is an example. Now
one can imagine taking a selector \(S\) for \(\sH\) and
“thinning out” each intersection \(S \cap X\) for \(X\in
\sH\) until it contains just a single element. The result is a
transversal for \(\sH\). This argument, suitably refined, yields a
precise derivation of
AC in this formulation from the set-theoretical
principle known as Zorn’s lemma (see below). 
 Let us call Zermelo’s 1908 formulation the combinatorial
 axiom of choice: 
CAC: 
 Any collection of mutually disjoint nonempty sets has a
transversal.
 It is to be noted that AC1 and CAC
for finite collections of sets are both provable (by
induction) in the usual set theories. But in the case of an
infinite collection, even when each of its members is finite,
the question of the existence of a choice function or a transversal is
 problematic[4].
 For example, as already mentioned, it is easy to come up with a
choice function for the collection of pairs of real numbers (simply
choose the smaller element of each pair). But it is by no means
obvious how to produce a choice function for the collection of pairs
of arbitrary sets of real numbers.
 Zermelo’s original purpose in introducing AC was to
establish a central principle of Cantor’s set theory, namely, that
every set admits a well-ordering and so can also be assigned a
cardinal number. Zermelo’s 1904 introduction of the axiom, as well as
the use to which he put it, provoked considerable criticism from the
mathematicians of the day.  The chief objection raised was to what
some saw as its highly non-constructive, even idealist, character:
while the axiom asserts the possibility of making a number 
of—perhaps even an uncountable number—of arbitrary
“choices”, it gives no indication whatsoever of how these
latter are actually to be effected, of how, otherwise put, choice
functions are to be defined. This was particularly
objectionable to mathematicians of a “constructive” bent
such as the so-called French Empiricists Baire, Borel and Lebesgue,
for whom a mathematical object could be asserted to exist only if it
can be defined in such a way as to characterize it uniquely.
Zermelo’s response to his critics came in the form in two papers in
1908. In the first of these, as remarked above, he
reformulated AC in terms of transversals; in the second
(1908a) he made explicit the further assumptions needed to carry
through his proof of the well-ordering theorem. These assumptions
constituted the first explicit presentation of an axiom system for set
theory.
 As the debate concerning the Axiom of Choice rumbled on, it became
apparent that the proofs of a number of significant mathematical
theorems made essential use of it, thereby leading many mathematicians
to treat it as an indispensable tool of their trade.  Hilbert, for
example, came to regard AC as an essential principle of
mathematics[5] and
employed it in his defence of classical mathematical reasoning against
the attacks of the intuitionists.  Indeed his ε-operators are
essentially just choice functions (see the entry on the
  epsilon calculus).
 Although the usefulness of AC quickly become clear,
doubts about its soundness remained. These doubts were reinforced by
the fact that it had certain strikingly counterintuitive
consequences.  The most spectacular of these was Banach
and Tarski’s paradoxical decompositions of the sphere
(Banach and Tarski 1924): any solid sphere can be split into finitely
many pieces which can be reassembled to form two solid spheres of the
same size; and any solid sphere can be split into finitely many
pieces in such a way as to enable them to be reassembled to form a
solid sphere of arbitrary size. (See Wagon 1993.) 
 It was not until the middle 1930s that the question of the soundness
of AC was finally put to rest with Kurt Gödel’s
proof of its consistency relative to the other axioms of set theory.
 Here is a brief chronology of
 AC:[6]
As stated above, in 1922 Fraenkel proved the independence of
AC from a system of set theory containing
“atoms”. Here by an atom is meant a pure
individual, that is, an entity having no members and yet distinct from
the empty set (so a fortiori an atom cannot be a set). In a
system of set theory with atoms it is assumed that one is given an
infinite set \(A\) of atoms. One can build a
universe \(V(A)\) of sets over \(A\) by starting
with \(A\), adding all the subsets of \(A\), adjoining all
the subsets of the result, etc., and iterating
transfinitely.  \(V(A)\) is then a model of set theory
with atoms. The kernel of Fraenkel’s method for proving the
independence of AC is the observation that, since atoms
cannot be set-theoretically distinguished, any permutation of the set
\(A\) of atoms induces a structure-preserving 
permutation—an automorphism—of the universe
\(V(A)\) of sets built from \(A\). This idea may be
used to construct another model \(Sym(V)\) of 
set theory—a permutation or symmetric model—in
which a set of mutually disjoint pairs of elements of \(A\) has
no choice function.  
           
Now let us suppose that we are given a group \(G\) of
automorphisms of \(A\). Let us say that an automorphism \(\pi\); of
\(A\) fixes an element \(x\) of
\(V(A)\) if \(\pi(x) = x\). Clearly, if
\(\pi \in G\) fixes every element of \(A\), it also
fixes every element of \(V(A)\). Now it may be the case
that, for certain elements \(x \in V(A)\),
the fixing of the elements of a subset of \(A\) by any
\(\pi\in G\) suffices to fix \(x\). We are therefore
led to define a support for \(x\) to be a subset
\(X\) of \(A\) such that, whenever \(\pi\in G\)
fixes each member of \(X\), it also fixes \(x\). Members of
\(V(A)\) possessing a finite support are called
symmetric.
We next define the universe \(Sym(V)\) to consist of the
hereditarily symmetric members of \(V(A)\),
that is, those \(x\in V(A)\) such that
\(x\), the elements of \(x\), the elements of elements of
\(x\), etc., are all symmetric. \(Sym(V)\) is also
a model of set theory with set of atoms \(A\), and \(\pi\) induces
an automorphism of \(Sym(V)\).
           
Now suppose \(A\) to be partitioned into a (necessarily infinite)
mutually disjoint set \(P\) of pairs. Take \(G\) to be the group of
permutations of \(A\) which fix all the pairs in \(P\). Then \(P\in
Sym(V)\); it can now be shown that \(Sym(V)\) contains no choice
function on \(P\). For suppose \(f\) were a choice function on \(P\)
and \(f \in Sym(V)\). Then \(f\) has a finite support which may be
taken to be of the form \(\{a_{1}, \ldots, a_{n}, b_{1},\ldots,b_{n}\}
with each pair \{a_{i}, b_{i}\} \in P\). Since \(P\) is infinite, we
may select a pair \(\{c, d\} = U\) from \(P\) different from all the
\(\{a_{i}, b_{i}\}\). Now we define \(\pi \in G\) so that \(\pi\)
fixes each \(a_{i}\) and \(b_{i}\) and interchanges \(c\) and
\(d\). Then \(\pi\) also fixes \(f\). Since \(f\) was supposed to be a
choice function on \(P\), and \(U \in P\), we must have \(f(U) \in
U\), that is, \(f(U) = c\) or \(f(U) = d\). Since \(\pi\) interchanges
\(c\) and \(d\), it follows that \(\pi(f(U)) \ne f(U)\). But since
\(\pi\) is an automorphism, it also preserves function application, so
that \(\pi(f(U)) = \pi f(\pi(U))\). But
\(\pi(U) = U\) and \(\pi f = f\), whence
\(\pi(f(U)) = f(U)\). We have duly arrived at a contradiction,
showing that the universe \(Sym(V)\) contains no choice
function on \(P\).
The point here is that for a symmetric function \(f\) defined on
\(P\) there is a finite list \(L\) of pairs from \(P\)
the fixing of all of whose elements suffices to fix \(f\), and
hence also all the values of \(f\). Now, for any pair \(U\)
in \(P\) but not in \(L\) , a permutation \(\pi\) can always be
found which fixes all the elements of the pairs in \(L\), but
does not fix the members of \(U\). Since \(\pi\) must fix the value
of \(f\) at \(U\), that value cannot lie in \(U\).
Therefore \(f\) cannot “choose” an element of
\(U\), so a fortiori \(f\) cannot be a choice function on
\(P\).
           
This argument shows that collections of sets of atoms need
not necessarily have choice functions, but it fails to establish the
same fact for the “usual” sets of mathematics, for example
the set of real numbers. This had to wait until 1963 when Paul Cohen
showed that it is consistent with the standard axioms of set theory
(which preclude the existence of atoms) to assume that a countable
collection of pairs of sets of real numbers fails to have a choice
function. The core of Cohen’s method of proof—the celebrated
method of forcing—was vastly more general than any
previous technique; nevertheless his independence proof also made
essential use of permutation and symmetry in essentially the form in
which Fraenkel had originally employed them.
           
Gödel’s proof of the relative consistency of AC 
with the axioms of set theory (see the entry on 
 Kurt Gödel)
 rests on an entirely different idea: that of
definability. He introduced a new hierarchy of 
sets—the constructible hierarchy—by analogy with the
cumulative type hierarchy. We recall that the latter is defined by the
following recursion on the ordinals, where \(\sP(X)\) is
the power set of \(X\), \(\alpha\) is an ordinal, and \(\lambda\) is
a limit ordinal::
The constructible hierarchy is defined by a similar recursion on the
ordinals, where \(\Def(X)\) is the set of all subsets of
\(X\) which are first-order definable in the structure
\((X, \in, (x)_{x\in X})\):[7]
The constructible universe is the class 
\(L = \bigcup_{\alpha\in \Ord} L_{\alpha}\); the members of \(L\) are the
constructible sets. Gödel showed that (assuming the
axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory ZF) the
structure \((L, \in)\) is a model of ZF and
also of AC as well as the Generalized Continuum
Hypothesis). The relative consistency of AC with
ZF follows.  
It was also observed by Gödel (1964) (and, independently, by
Myhill and Scott 1971, Takeuti 1963 and Post 1951) that a simpler
proof of the relative consistency of AC can be
formulated in terms of ordinal definability. If we write
\(\rD(X)\) for the set of all subsets of \(X\) which are
first-order definable in the structure \((X, \in)\), then the
class OD of ordinal definable sets is defined to be the
union \(\bigcup_{\alpha\in \Ord}  D(V_{\alpha})\).
 The class HOD of hereditarily ordinal definable sets
consists of all sets \(a\) for which \(a\), the members of
\(a\), the members of members of \(a\), … etc., are
all ordinal definable. It can then be shown that the structure (HOD,
\(\in\)) is a model of ZF + AC , from
which the relative consistency of AC  with
ZF again
 follows.[8]
The Axiom of Choice is closely allied to a group of mathematical
propositions collectively known as maximal principles.
Broadly speaking, these propositions assert that certain conditions
are sufficient to ensure that a partially ordered set contains at
least one maximal element, that is, an element such that,
with respect to the given partial ordering, no element strictly
exceeds it.
           
To see the connection between the idea of a maximal element and
AC, let us return to the latter’s formulation
AC2 in terms of indexed sets. Accordingly suppose we
are given an indexed family of nonempty sets \(\sA = \{A_{i}:i \in
I\}.\) Let us define a potential choice function on \(\sA\)
to be a function \(f\) whose domain is a subset of \(I\) such that
\(f(i) \in A_{i}\) for all \(i\in J\).  (Here the use of the
qualifier potential is suggested by the fact that the domain
is a subset of \(I\); recall that a choice function \(f\) on \(\sA\)
has the same properties as what we are now calling potential choice
functions except that the domain of \(f\) is required to be all of
\(I\), not just a subset.) The set \(P\) of potential choice functions
on \(\sA\) can be partially ordered by inclusion: we agree that, for
potential choice functions \(f, g \in P\), the relation \(f \le g\)
holds provided that the domain of \(f\) is included in that of \(g\)
and the value of \(f\) at an element of its domain coincides with the
value of \(g\) there. It is now easy to see that the maximal elements
of \(P\) with respect to the partial ordering \(\le\) are precisely
the choice functions on \(\sA\). 
Zorn’s Lemma is the best-known principle ensuring the
existence of such maximal elements.  To state it, we need a few
definitions. Given a partially ordered set \((P, \le)\), an
upper bound for a subset \(X\) of \(P\) is an element \(a\in
P\) for which \(x\le a\) for every \(x\in X\); a maximal
element of \(P\) may then be defined as an element \(a\) for
which the set of upper bounds of \(\{a\}\) coincides with \(\{a\}\),
which essentially means that no element of \(P\) is strictly larger
than \(a\). A chain in \((P,\le)\) is a subset \(C\) of \(P\)
such that, for any \(x\), \(y\in P\), either \(x\le y\) or \(y\le x\). 
\(P\) is said to be inductive if every chain in \(P\)
has an upper bound. Now Zorn’s Lemma asserts:
Zorn’s Lemma (ZL): 
 Every nonempty inductive
partially ordered set has a maximal element.
           
Why is Zorn’s Lemma plausible? Here is an informal argument.
Given a nonempty inductive partially ordered set \((P,\le)\), pick an
arbitrary element \(p_{0}\) of \(P\). If \(p_{0}\) is maximal, stop
there. Otherwise pick an element \(p_{1} \gt p_{0}\); if \(p_{1}\) is
maximal, stop there. Otherwise pick an element \(p_{2} \gt p_{1}\),
and repeat the process. If none of the elements \(p_{0} \lt p_{1} \lt
p_{2} \lt \ldots \lt p_{n} \lt \ldots\) is maximal, the \(p_{i}\) form
a chain which, since \(P\) is inductive, has an upper bound
\(q_{0}\). If \(q_{0}\) is maximal, stop there. Otherwise the
procedure can be repeated with \(q_{0} \lt q_{1}\), …, and then
iterated. This process must eventually terminate, since otherwise the
union of the chains so generated would constitute a proper class,
making \(P\) itself a proper class contrary to assumption. The
point at which the process terminates yields a maximal element
of \(P\).
 This argument, suitably rigorized, gives a
 proof[9]
 of ZL from AC1 in Zermelo-Fraenkel
set theory: in this proof AC1 is used to
“pick” the elements referred to in the informal
argument.
           
Another version of Zorn’s Lemma can be given in terms of
collections of sets. Given a collection \(\sH\) of sets, let us call
a nest in \(\sH\) any subcollection \(\sN\) of \(\sH\) such
that, for any pair of members of \(\sN\), one is included in the
 other.[10] 
Call \(\sH\) strongly inductive if the union of any nest in
\(\sH\) is a member of \(\sH\).  Zorn’s Lemma may then be
equivalently restated as the assertion that any nonempty strongly
inductive collection \(\sH\) of sets has a maximal member, that is, a
member properly included in no member of \(\sH\).  This may in turn be
formulated in a dual form. Call a family of sets
strongly reductive if it is closed under intersections of
nests. Then any nonempty strongly reductive family of sets has a
minimal element, that is, a member properly including no
member of the family.
AC2 is now easily derived from Zorn’s Lemma in
this alternative form. For the set \(P\) of potential choice functions
on an indexed family of sets \(\sA\) is clearly nonempty and is
readily shown to be strongly inductive; so Zorn’s lemma yields
the existence of a choice function on \(\sA\). 
CAC can be derived from
ZL in a way echoing the “combinatorial”
justification of CAC sketched above. Accordingly
suppose we are given a family \(\sH\) of mutually disjoint nonempty
sets; call a subset \(S \subseteq \bigcup \sH\) a sampling
for \(\sH\) if, for any \(X\in \sH\), either 
\(X \subseteq S\) or \(S \cap X\) is nonempty and
finite. Minimal samplings are precisely transversals for
 \(\sH\);[11] 
and the collection \(\sT\) of samplings is clearly nonempty since it
contains \(\bigcup \sH\).  So if it can be shown that \(\sT\) is
strongly 
 reductive,[12] 
 Zorn’s lemma will yield a minimal element of \(\sT\) and so a
transversal for \(\sH\).  The strong reductiveness of \(\sT\) may be
seen as follows: suppose that \(\{S_{i}: i\in I\}\) is a nest of
samplings; let \(S = {\bigcap}_{i\in I} S_{i}\).  We need to show that
\(S\) is itself a sampling; to this end let \(X \in \sH\) and suppose
\(\neg(X \subseteq S)\). Then there is \(i \in I\) for which 
\(\neg(X \subseteq S_{i})\); since \(S_{i}\) is a sampling, \(S_{i}\cap X\) is
finite and nonempty,
say \(S_{i}\cap X = \{x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\}\). Clearly 
\(S\cap X\) is then finite; suppose for the sake of contradiction that
\(S\cap X = \varnothing\). Then for each \(k = 1,\ldots,n\) there is 
\(i_k \in I\) for which \(\neg(x_k \in S_{i_k})\). It follows that
\(\neg(S_{i} \subseteq S_{i_k})\), for \(k = 1, \ldots, n\).  
So, since the \(S_{i}\) form a chain, each \(S_{i_k}\) is a subset of
\(S_{i}\). Let \(S_{j}\) be the least of \(S_{i_1},\ldots, S_{i_k}\);
then \(S_{j}\subseteq S_{i}\). But since \(\neg(x_{k} \in S_{j})\),
for \(k = 1, \ldots, n\), it now follows that \(S_{j} \cap X =
\varnothing\), contradicting the fact that \(S_{j}\) is a sampling.
Therefore \(S \cap X\ne \varnothing\); and \(S\) is a sampling as
claimed.
           
We note that while Zorn’s lemma and the Axiom of Choice are
set-theoretically equivalent, it is much more difficult to derive the
former from the latter than vice-versa.
           
Here is a brief chronology of maximal principles.
The Axiom of Choice has numerous applications in mathematics, a
number of which have proved to be formally equivalent to
 it[13].
 Historically the most important application was the first, namely:
The Well-Ordering Theorem (Zermelo 1904,
1908). Every set can be well-ordered.  
After Zermelo published his 1904 proof of the well-ordering theorem
from AC, it was quickly seen that the two are equivalent.
Another early equivalent of AC is
The Multiplicative Axiom (Russell 1906). The
product of any set of non-zero cardinal numbers is non-zero.
Early applications of AC include:
A significant “folklore” equivalent of AC is
The Set-Theoretic Distributive Law. For an
arbitrary doubly-indexed family of sets
\(\{M_{i,j}: i \in I,j \in J\}\), and where
\(J^I\) is the set of all functions with
domain \(I\) and which take values in \(J\):
 A much-studied special case of AC is the
Principle of Dependent Choices (Bernays 1942, Tarski
1948). For any nonempty relation \(R\) on a set \(A\) for which
\(\range(R) \subseteq \domain(R)\), there is a function \(f: \omega
\rightarrow A\) such that, for all \(n\in \omega, R(f(n),f(n+1))\).
This principle, although (much) weaker than AC, cannot be
proved without it in the context of the remaining axioms of set
theory.
 Mathematical equivalents of AC include:
 There are a number of mathematical consequences of AC
which are known to be
 weaker[14]
 than it, in particular:
 Finally, there is
 The question of the equivalence of this with AC is one of
the few remaining interesting open questions in this area; while it
clearly implies BPI, it was proved independent of
BPI in Bell 1983.
 Many of these theorems are discussed in Bell and Machover (1977).
An initial connection between AC and logic emerges by
returning to its formulation AC3 in terms of
relations, namely: any binary relation contains a function with the
same domain. This version of AC is naturally
expressible within a second-order language \(L\) with individual
variables \(x\), \(y\), \(z\), … and function
variables \(f\), \(g\), \(h\), …. In \(L\),
binary relations are represented by formulas
\(\phi(x, y)\) with two free individual
variables \(x\), \(y\). The counterpart in \(L\) of the
assertion AC3 is then
This scheme of sentences is the standard logical form of
AC.
Zermelo’s original form of the Axiom of Choice,
AC1, can be expressed as a scheme of sentences within
a suitably strengthened version of \(L\). Accordingly we now
suppose \(L\) to contain in addition predicate
variables \(X\), \(Y\), \(Z\), … and
second-order function variables \(F\), \(G\), \(H\),
…. Here a second-order function variable \(F\) may be
applied to a predicate variable \(X\) to yield an individual term
\(FX\).   The scheme of sentences
 is the direct counterpart of AC1 in this
strengthened second-order language. In words, AC1L
asserts that, if each predicate having a certain property
\(\Phi\) has instances, then there is a function \(F\) on
predicates such that, for any predicate \(X\) satisfying
\(\Phi\), \(FX\) is an instance of \(X\). Here
predicates are playing the role of sets.
 Up to now we have tacitly assumed our background logic to be the
usual classical logic. But the true depth of the connection between
AC and logic emerges only when
intuitionistic or constructive logic is brought into
the picture. It is a remarkable fact that, assuming only the framework
of intuitionistic logic together with certain mild further
presuppositions, the Axiom of Choice can be shown to entail the
cardinal rule of classical logic, the law of excluded 
middle—the assertion that \(A \vee \neg A\) for any proposition
\(A\). To be precise, using the rules of intuitionistic logic
within our augmented language \(L\), we shall
 derive[15]
 the law of excluded middle from AC1L conjoined with
the following additional principles:
Predicative Comprehension:
\(\exists X \forall x[X(x) \leftrightarrow \phi(x)]\), where \(\phi\)
contains no bound function or predicate variables.
Extensionality of Functions:
\(\forall X \forall Y \forall F[X \approx Y \rightarrow  FX = FY]\), where 
\(X \approx Y\) is an abbreviation for
\(\forall x[X(x) \leftrightarrow Y(x)]\), that is, \(X\) and \(Y\) are
extensionally equivalent.
Two Distinct Individuals:
\(\uO \ne \uI\), where \(\uO\) and \(\uI\) are
individual constants.
 Now let \(A\) be a given proposition. By Predicative
Comprehension, we may introduce predicate constants \(U\),
\(V\) together with the assertions
Let \(\Phi(X)\) be the formula \(X \approx U \vee X \approx V\). Then
clearly we may assert \(\forall X[\Phi(X) \rightarrow \exists xX(x)]\)
so AC1L may be invoked to assert \(\exists F \forall
X[\Phi(X) \rightarrow X(FX)]\). Now we can introduce a function
constant \(K\) together with the assertion
Since evidently we may assert \(\Phi(U)\) and \(\Phi(V)\), it follows
from (2) that we may assert \(U(KU)\) and \(V(KV)\), whence also,
using (1),
Using the distributive law (which holds in intuitionistic logic), it
follows that we may assert
From the presupposition that \(0 \ne 1\) it follows that
 is assertable. But it follows from (1) that we may assert \(A
\rightarrow U ≈ V\), and so also, using the Extensionality of
Functions, \(A \rightarrow KU = KV\). This yields the assertability of
\(KU \ne KV \rightarrow  \neg A\),
which, together with (3) in turn yields the assertability of
that is, the law of excluded middle.
The fact that the Axiom of Choice implies Excluded Middle seems at
first sight to be at variance with the fact that the former is often
taken as a valid principle in systems of constructive
mathematics governed by intuitionistic logic, e.g. Bishop’s
 Constructive Analysis[16] 
 and Martin-Löf’s Constructive Type
 Theory[17], in
 which Excluded Middle is not affirmed. In Bishop’s words, “A
choice function exists in constructive mathematics because a choice is
implied by the very meaning of existence.” Thus, for
example, the antecedent 
\(\forall x \exists y \phi(x,y)\) of ACL, given a
constructive construal, just means that we have a procedure
which, applied to each \(x\), yields a \(y\) for which
\(\phi(x, y)\). But this is precisely what is expressed by the
consequent \(\exists f \forall x \phi(x,fx)\) of ACL.
 To resolve the difficulty, we note that in deriving Excluded Middle
from ACL1 essential use was made of the principles of
Predicative Comprehension and Extensionality of
 Functions[18]. 
 It follows that, in systems of constructive mathematics affirming
AC (but not Excluded Middle) either the principle
of Predicative Comprehension or the principle of Extensionality of
Functions must fail. While the principle of Predicative
Comprehension can be given a constructive justification, no such
justification can be provided for the principle of Extensionality of
Functions. Functions on predicates are given intensionally, and
satisfy just the corresponding principle of Intensionality
\(\forall X \forall Y \forall F[X = Y \rightarrow  FX = FY]\). The
principle of Extensionality can easily be made to fail by considering,
for example, the predicates \(P\): rational featherless
biped and \(Q\): human being and the function
\(K\) on predicates which assigns to each predicate the number of
words in its description. Then we can agree that \(P \approx
Q\) but \(KP = 3\) and \(KQ = 2\).
 In intuitionistic set theory (that is, set theory based on
intuitionistic as opposed to classical logic—we shall abbreviate
this as IST) and in topos theory the principles of
Predicative Comprehension and Extensionality of Functions (both
appropriately construed) hold and so there AC implies
Excluded
 Middle.[19]

[20]
 The derivation of Excluded Middle from AC was first given by
Diaconescu (1975) in a category-theoretic setting. His proof employed
essentially different ideas from the proof presented above; in
particular, it makes no use of extensionality principles but instead
employs the idea of the quotient of an object (or set) by an
equivalence relation. It is instructive to formulate
Diaconescu’s argument within IST. To do this,
let us call a subset \(U\) of a set \(A\) detachable if there
is a subset \(V\) of \(A\) for which \(U \cap V = \varnothing\) and
\(U \cup V = A\).  Diaconescu’s argument amounts to a derivation
from AC4 (see above) of the assertion that every
subset of a set is detachable, from which Excluded Middle readily
follows. Here it is.
 First, given \(U \subseteq A\), an indicator for
\(U\) (in \(A\)) is a map \(g: A \times 2 \rightarrow 2\) 
satisfying
 It is then easy to show that a subset is detachable if and only if
it has an indicator. 
 Now we show that, if AC4 holds, then any subset of a
set has an indicator, and hence is detachable.
 For \(U \subseteq A\), let \(R\) be the binary
relation on \(A + A = A \times \{0\} \cup A \times \{1\}\)
given by
It can be checked that \(R\) is an equivalence relation. Write
\(r\) for the natural map from \(A + A\) to the
 quotient[21]
 \(Q\) of \((A + A)\) by \(R\) which carries
each member of \(A + A\) to its \(R-\)equivalence
class.
 Now apply AC4 to obtain a map 
\(f: Q \rightarrow  A + A\) satisfying 
\(f(X) \in X\) for all \(X \in Q\). It is then not
hard to show that, writing \(\pi_{1}\) for projection on the
first coordinate,
and
 Now define \(g: A \times 2 \rightarrow 2\) by \(g = \pi_{2} \circ f
\circ r\), where \(\pi_2\) is a projection on the second
coordinate. Then \(g\) is an indicator for \(U\), as the
following equivalences show:
The proof is complete.
 It can be shown (Bell 2006) that each of a number of
intuitionistically invalid logical principles, including the law of
excluded middle, is equivalent (in intuitionistic set theory)
to a suitably weakened version of the axiom of choice.  Accordingly
these logical principles may be viewed as choice principles.
Here are the logical principles at issue:
 Over intuitionistic logic, Lin,
Stone and Ex are consequences of
SLEM; and Un implies
Dis. All of these schemes follow, of course, from the
full law of excluded middle, that is SLEM for
arbitrary formulas.
 In what follows the empty set is denoted by 0, \(\{0\}\) by 1, and
\(\{0, 1\}\) by 2. 
 We formulate the following choice principles—here \(X\)
is an arbitrary set, \(\Fun(X)\) the class of functions with
domain \(X\) and \(\phi(x,y)\) an arbitrary
formula of the language of set theory with at most the free variables
\(x\), \(y\):
 The first two of these are forms of AC for
\(X\); while classically equivalent, in IST
AC\(^*_X\) implies AC\(_X\), but not
conversely. The principles DAC\(_X\) and
DAC\(^*_X\) are dual forms of the axiom of
choice for \(X\): classically they are both equivalent to
AC\(_X\) and AC\(^*_X\) but
intuitionistically DAC\(^*_X\)
implies DAC\(_X\), and not conversely.
We also formulate the weak extensional selection principle,
in which \(\alpha(x)\) and \(\beta(x)\) are any formulas
with at most the variable \(x\) free:
WESP:
\({\exists x\inn 2}\ \alpha(x) \wedge
{\exists x \inn 2}\ \beta(x) \rightarrow 
{\exists x \inn 2}\ {\exists y \inn 2}\ [\alpha(x) \wedge
\beta(y) \wedge [{\forall x \inn 2}\
[\alpha(x) \leftrightarrow \beta(x)] \rightarrow  x = y]].\)
 This principle, a straightforward consequence of the axiom of choice,
asserts that, for any pair of instantiated properties of members of 2,
instances may be assigned to the properties in a manner that depends
just on their extensions.
 Each of the logical principles tabulated above is equivalent (in
IST) to a choice principle. In fact:
 Further, while DAC\(_1\) is easily seen to be
provable in IST, we have
 Next, while AC\(_2\) is easily proved in
IST, by contrast we have
 In order to provide choice schemes equivalent to Lin
and Stone we introduce
ac\(^*_X\):
\({\exists f \inn 2^X} [{\forall x\inn X}\ {\exists y \inn 2}\ \phi(x,y) 
\rightarrow {\exists x \inn X}\ \phi(x,fx)]\)
wac\(^*_X\):
\({\exists f \inn 2^X} [{\forall x \inn X}\ {\exists y \inn 2}\ \phi(x,y) 
\rightarrow  {\forall x \inn X}\ \phi(x,fx)]\) provided it is provable in
IST that 
\(\forall x[\phi(x,0) \rightarrow  \neg\phi(x,1)]\)
Clearly ac\(^*_X\) is equivalent to
\({\exists f \inn 2^X}[{\forall x \inn X}[\phi(x,0) \vee \phi(x,1)] \rightarrow 
{\forall x \inn X}\ \phi(x,fx)]\)
 and similarly for
dac\(^*_X\).
 Then, over IST,
ac\(^*_1\) and dac\(^*_1\) are
equivalent, respectively, to Lin and
Stone.
 These results show just how deeply choice principles interact with
logic, when the background logic is assumed to be intuitionistic. In a
classical setting where the Law of Excluded Middle is assumed these
connections are obliterated.
