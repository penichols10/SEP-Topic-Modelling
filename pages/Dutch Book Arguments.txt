The conclusion of the DBA is that the degrees of belief, or credences,
that an agent attaches to the members of a set \(X\) of sentences,
statements, or propositions, should satisfy the axioms of probability.
The basic axioms of probability are generally taken as requiring that
for \(A \in X\),
Condition 2, which requires only that the truths of propositional
logic are given the value one, is sometimes replaced with
or even
The distinctions between these formulations of the axioms bear on
the objects that probabilities are to be taken as attaching to and on the
reasonableness of the argument’s conclusion; but, for the
immediate purpose of outlining the basic argument, the differences are
not crucial.
The DBA itself begins with the so-called Dutch Book theorem, which
concerns the conditions under which a set of bets guarantees a net loss
to one side, or a Dutch Book. With de Finetti, it is here assumed that
a bet on a proposition \(H\) is an arrangement that has the following
canonical form:
The table gives the net payoff to an agent who buys a bet with stake
\(S\) for the price \(qS\), where \(S\) is won
if \(H\) is true. \(S\) is called the
stake, as it is the total amount involved in the wager, that
is the payoff in the case that \(H\) is true together with the
amount forfeited if \(H\) is false. The quantity \(q\) is called
the betting quotient, which is the amount lost if \(H\) is
false divided by the stake. The Dutch Book theorem can now be
stated:
Given a set of betting quotients that fails to satisfy the
probability axioms, there is a set of bets with those quotients that
guarantees a net loss to one side.
It is easy to show how it is possible to make book against someone
with betting quotients that violate the probability axioms. Let
\(Q(H)\) be the agent’s betting quotient for \(H\). Assuming that
the agent’s betting quotients violate the axioms, a bookie can
guarantee himself a profit by placing bets with the agent as described
below. For simplicity the stake is set here at $1, but the
following recipes for constructing a book against such a person are
easily adapted for other stakes.
Axiom 1: Suppose that \(Q(H) \lt 0\). In this case, the
bookie buys the bet that pays $1 if \(H\) is true and 0 otherwise,
for the negative price \(Q(H)\), which means that the agent
collects \(Q(H)\), and pays out $1 if \(H\) is true, and
$0 otherwise. Here the agent is betting against \(H\) and the
payoff table for the agent is as follows:
Since \(Q(H)\) is negative, the agent will suffer a net loss regardless
of the truth-value of \(H\).
Axiom 2: Suppose that an agent’s betting quotient for a
tautology (or a logical or necessary truth) \(H\) is not equal to
1. If \(Q(H) \gt 1\) the bookie sells the bet that pays $1 if \(H\) is
true and 0 otherwise, for \(Q(H)\). In the case where \(Q(H) \lt 1\),
the bookie will buy the bet in which the agent pays the bookie $1 if
\(H\) is true, and nothing if \(H\) is false, for \(Q(H)\). In this
case, the payoff table for the agent will again be as above for axiom
1.  Notice that since \(H\) is a tautology (or logical or necessary
truth) it must be true, which means that at the conclusion of the bet,
the agent will have lost [\(1-Q(H)\)].
Axiom 3 (Additivity): Assume that
\(H_{1}\) and \(H_{2}\) are mutually exclusive and
that \(Q(H_{1}\vee H_{2})
\ne Q(H_{1}) + Q(H_{2})\).
There are two cases,
If \(Q(H_{1}\vee H_{2}) \lt Q(H_{1}) + Q(H_{2})\), then the bookie
will offer the agent the bet that pays $1 if \(H_{1}\) and 0 otherwise
for \(Q(H_{1})\) and the bet that pays $1 if \(H_{2}\) is true and 0
otherwise for \(Q(H_{2})\). The bookie then buys the bet that will pay
him $1, if \((H_{1}\vee H_{2})\) is true and 0 otherwise, for the
price of \(Q(H_{1}\vee H_{2})\). The possible payoffs to the agent are
summed up in the following table:
Since \(Q(H_{1}\vee H_{2})
\lt Q(H_{1}) + Q(H_{2})\),
the agent loses in each case and thus the collection of bets assures a
loss. If \(Q(H_{1}\vee H_{2})
\gt Q(H_{1}) + Q(H_{2})\),
then the bookie simply reverses the direction of the bets.
Letting \(V(H)\) be the payoff if \(H\) is true, the
expected value of a bet on
\(H\) is expressed by the equation:
Thus, for each axiom, the individual bets involved in making the
book are fair, which is to say they have an expected value of zero,
when calculated using the agent’s betting quotients, yet
collectively they will produce a sure loss. The Dutch Book
argument assumes that an agent’s degrees of belief are linked
with her betting quotients. This together with the theorem
establishes that degrees of belief that violate the probability axioms
are associated with bets that are fair in the above sense, but that
lead to a sure loss. The argument then concludes that agents
ought to obey the axioms. This leaves open just what the
association amounts to and what sort of problem the prospect of such
sure loss is supposed to be.
The Dutch Book argument has often been presented as establishing that
degrees of belief that violate the axioms are irrational because they
can (or do) lead to bad consequences. It assumes that an agent’s
degrees of belief are associated with her betting quotients such that
(1) for an agent with degree of belief \(q\) in \(M\) a bet on
or against \(M\) at corresponding odds will be acceptable. With
payoffs in dollars and stake \(S\), this amounts to the claim that
the agent should be willing to take either direction of a bet with a
cost of $\(Sq\) that pays
But then (2) by the Dutch Book theorem a cunning bettor could assure
himself a profit from someone who violates the probability
axioms. Since (3) violating the axioms leaves the bettor open to
being Dutch Booked (that is, being on the losing side of the Dutch
Book) because her degrees of belief make acceptable bets leading to a
sure loss, it is concluded that (4) one ought to satisfy the
probability axioms (i.e. that probabilism is true). In some
presentations, the first premise is strengthened to the claim that the
agent actually will accept those bets on \(M\) for which her degree of belief
matches the betting quotient, in an effort to tighten the connection
between violating the axioms and the sure loss.
A bit of terminology is in need of clarification here. De Finetti
identified degrees of belief with betting quotients and termed degrees
of belief that are susceptible to a Dutch Book incoherent;
those that are not so susceptible he called coherent (de Finetti
1937). ‘Susceptible’ here should be understood in the
sense of the above theorem, namely that bets are specifiable
corresponding to those degrees of belief that will produce a sure loss
to one side. Given the theorem, coherence amounts to satisfaction of
the probability axioms, with incoherence involving their violation,
and accordingly the terms are often used as a shorthand way of
specifying whether the axioms are satisfied. However, both Ramsey and
de Finetti took incoherence to be a kind of inconsistency, and some
use the term in this sense.  There are various questions about
understanding violation of the probability axioms and susceptibility
to a Dutch Book in this way, as will be discussed, and so here it will
be best to use ‘incoherent’ for degrees of belief that
violate the probability axioms, and that by the Dutch Book theorem are
associated with susceptibility to a sure loss.
There is reason to accept the conclusion of the DBA that one ought to
satisfy the probability axioms so as to avoid a Dutch Book only insofar
as satisfying the axioms affords at least the possibility of avoiding
exposure to a sure loss (Hájek 2005, 2008).
Here, the Converse Dutch Book theorem, proven independently by Lehman
(1955) and Kemeny (1955), plays an important role. Roughly
stated the result is that
It assures that the agent would not be exploitable in any event, and
thus establishes an advantage to obeying the axioms. Notice that the
theorem states that having betting quotients adhering to the axioms
assures that one will not be susceptible to a sure loss, rather than
making just the minimal claim required to establish an advantage to
coherence that such vulnerability may be avoided.
Both the Dutch Book theorem and its converse are sensitive to the
formulation of the axioms, as well as to the understanding of
‘bet’, ‘sure loss’ and what it means for such a
loss to be guaranteed. Special care must be taken with the
characterization of the probability axioms when it comes to the
Converse Dutch Book theorem. Given that the axioms are formulated
such that the second axiom only requires that tautological sentences
receive probability one, it is possible to satisfy the axioms, yet
still be open to a sure loss. Consider the claim that if \(b\) has \(F\)
then something has \(F\). This is not tautological, but betting
against it would leave one vulnerable to a sure loss. Sometimes
the second axiom is instead formulated as requiring that all logical
truths receive probability one, but satisfying this constraint leaves
open the possibility of a sure loss by betting against a necessary
truth such as ‘nothing is both red and green all
over’. Even with strengthening the second axiom to require
that all necessary truths receive probability one, there is still a
reading upon which the Converse Dutch Book theorem is false, since an
agent will be vulnerable to a sure loss if she attaches a probability
less than one to a known truth (or a probability greater than zero to a
known falsehood). One response to this is to restrict ‘sure
loss’ to those losses that do not depend on contingent
facts. Instead the restriction could be made to losses that are
‘sure’ in the sense that there is a mechanical formula for
inflicting the loss, thus removing the sort of counterexample to the Converse
Dutch Book theorem with which we began, and the need to strengthen the
axioms. A related move involves restricting the allowable bets,
rather than limiting what counts as a sure loss.
In observing that the Dutch Book theorem and the DBA are sensitive to
the formulation of the probability axioms, it should be noted that
whereas classical logic is generally presumed, probability axioms can
be formulated, with suitable adjustments, for non-classical
logics. Weatherson argues that this is appropriate in representations
of rational belief, and formulates axioms of probability that are
built upon an intuitionistic logic, for which he then gives a Dutch
Book argument (Weatherson 2003). 
It is clear that in order for the Dutch Book theorem to hold,
‘sure loss’ must be taken to mean loss if the bets are in
fact placed and settled. Violation of the probability axioms under any
of their formulations does not guarantee an actual loss. Still more
must be said here about the meaning of ‘sure loss’, which
suggests some sort of necessity but does not tell us whether this is
supposed to be a particular form of logical necessity, metaphysical
necessity, or perhaps some other relative necessity. If
‘sure loss’ were taken as foreseeable loss, then an agent
could violate the axioms by attaching positive probability to a
necessary falsehood, where there is no foreseeable loss given the
current state of knowledge concerning the proposition in
question. There is also an issue concerning whether it is the
agent who must be able to foresee the loss. If ‘sure’
means decidable, then neither the formulation that logical nor that
necessary truths receive probability one will do, since there is no
decision procedure for determining in general whether a given sentence
is a logical truth, let alone a necessary one. Clearly, there is
a delicate balance that must be struck between the formulation of the
probability axioms, and the understanding of ‘bets’ and
‘sure loss’ for the Dutch Book theorem and its converse to
hold.
There is a further issue with the Converse Dutch Book theorem, because
there are books that can be made against agents who violate other
probabilistic norms, such as Reflection, countable additivity and
others (see sections 3, 4, and 5). Satisfaction of the basic
axioms is no guarantee that one will not be open to a book due to
violation of some other norm. A correct formulation of the
theorem must accordingly restrict the form and number of the allowable
bets. Kemeny and Lehman put restrictions on the allowable bets (for
example their betting systems are restricted to a finite number of
bets), which seem to rule out such counterexamples. However, it
remains to be shown that avoiding book with such a restricted set of
bets suffices to justify adherence to the axioms. The problem
here becomes especially pressing with the observation, discussed in the
following section, that incoherent agents need not be generally
vulnerable to a sure loss, and thus that both coherent and incoherent
agents alike may be subject to some books and not others. What is
needed in arguing for adherence to the probability axioms is the
further claim that the bets which lead to sure losses and that are associated
with incoherence pose a special problem, although it seems that this
threatens the use that many proponents of the DBA have wanted to
make of Dutch Book arguments in defending other norms.
A related problem concerns the assumption made in the version of the
DBA presented in section 1.2 that agents will accept, or at least find
acceptable, those ‘fair bets’ on or against \(P\) where
their degree of belief matches the betting quotient for the bet. As
discussed in the next section, it is not true that all such bets will
be accepted, or even be regarded as acceptable, and additional bets
may be accepted (or found acceptable). For various reasons someone
might accept bets in cases where her credences do not correspond to
the betting quotients of those bets, including where the bets
constitute a Dutch Book. Thus, we need to be concerned more generally
with the array of bets that agents will accept (or find
acceptable). But since this widens the class of bets that can be used
to produce a book, if anything it makes the problem for the DBA that a
coherent agent may be subject to a Dutch Book even worse.  The version
of the DBA in section 1.2 could be modified with the claim that agents
accept (or find acceptable) only bets that are fair or favorable, that
is those with a non-negative expected value as calculated using their
degrees of belief. This rules out some additional bets that would
produce a Dutch Book for a coherent agent, but not those that enter
into the DBAs for other norms. However, this assumption does not hold
generally, and fails to address other issues confronting the
argument.
As noted above, the sure loss guaranteed by the Dutch Book theorem need
not amount to an actual loss. Indeed a bookie could reverse the
direction of the bets that would guarantee a loss for an incoherent
agent so as to guarantee her a win, or there could be some sort of
other prize that might be awarded for being incoherent. An
incoherent agent might not be confronted by a clever bookie who could,
or would, take advantage of her, perhaps because she can take effective
measures to avoid such folk. Even if so confronted, the agent can
always prevent a sure loss by simply refusing to bet. It won’t do
to respond to such a possibility by insisting on the stronger
assumption that an agent will always take bets where the expected value
of each is non-negative, because this simply gives the argument a false
premise. In any case, it is clear that the trouble with being
incoherent cannot be that it will lead to losses. Rather, the
idea behind the version of the argument in section 1.2 should be taken
to be that incoherence opens one up to sure losses, in a way that
having coherent beliefs does not (given an appropriate version of the
Converse Dutch Book theorem), and that such potential vulnerability
demands adherence to the axioms.
We may question whether either the conclusion that incoherence is
irrational or that one ought to satisfy the axioms follows from simply
being open to a sure loss. If the threat of such a loss is seen
as unlikely, say, if the agent thinks she won’t face a clever
bookie, has confidence that her charms will prevent her from ending up
on the losing side of a Dutch Book, or just thinks she won’t
take bets leading to a Dutch Book if they are offered, then it is hard
to see why the mere potential of a sure loss should demand coherence.
Another problem here is the special status accorded to sure
losses. In fact the potential sure loss is symmetric with a
possible sure gain. As Hájek emphasizes, there is a
corresponding “Czech Book Argument”, which parallels the
DBA, with the conclusion that one ought to violate the probability
calculus (Hájek 2005, 2008). Construed as above,
the DBA appears to be canceled out by the “Czech Book
Argument”, although Hájek shows that the potential
canceling out can be avoided by reformulating the DBA with the
assumption that the agent should accept bets that are either fair or
favorable (Hájek 2008). Still, it is compatible with the
Dutch Book theorem that an incoherent agent could end up on the side of
a sure gain, and so incoherence cannot be condemned as irrational
simply by citing the possibility of sure losses.
Although the threat of a sure loss may be remote, and an agent could
face a sure gain, there are some situations in which incoherence is
more closely tied to actual losses. Some versions of the DBA appeal to
such scenarios as a preliminary to attempting to establish the general
irrationality of being incoherent. One tactic has been to argue that
incoherence is irrational in so-called forced betting situations, and
then that the prohibition against being incoherent in such situations
can be universalized (Jackson and Pargetter 1976). In a forced betting
situation the agent is required to post betting quotients, and then to
place bets with those quotients, where the stake and direction of the
bets are dictated by an opponent. Assuming that the only source of
value is the money (valued linearly) involved in the wagers, it is
claimed that it is irrational to be incoherent in such a
situation. But this doesn’t follow if the irrationality is taken
as arising from actual losses that would result. Even in a forced
betting scenario, there may be reasons to suppose that incoherent
betting quotients will not be taken advantage of, as may occur if
making book would require knowledge of some very complicated logical
truth (Kennedy and Chihara 1979). Here too, the direction of the bets
could be chosen so that an incoherent agent will have a sure
gain. This would be an odd forced betting situation, but if the agent
had reason to believe that this would occur, it could actually be
advisable for her to post incoherent odds.
One might begin instead with a competitive betting situation, in which
it is given that both sides attempt to maximize their gain. Here
there is a closer connection between incoherence and loss, since the
bookie will be trying to maximize his profit, and so a sure gain for an
incoherent agent could only be the result of a mistake. If it is
assumed that the agent is also forced to bet and that the bookie will
act optimally, the agent should post coherent odds, for otherwise she
will be subject to a bankrupting Dutch Book. Of course if the
competitive situation is one in which the agent can refuse to bet,
having incoherent betting quotients need not leave her open to an
actual loss.
Even in those forced betting situations and competitive betting
situations in which it is irrational to post incoherent betting
quotients, it still need not be irrational to have incoherent degrees
of belief (Kennedy and Chihara 1979; Adams and Rosenkrantz
1980). For example, if the agent must post odds on what she knows
to be either a logical truth or a logical falsehood in a forced betting
situation, she may be better off with a betting quotient of either 1 or
0, rather than some intermediate value, for she is susceptible to a
Dutch Book in the latter event, but she could end up with the
objectively correct value in the former case and thus would avoid a
loss. But it seems that she can have reasons for an intermediate
level of confidence, making such an evaluation more rational, at least
in the sense of reflecting her available evidence, than an extreme
one. Alternatively the agent may simply have no idea whatsoever
about the logical status of what is in fact a logical truth upon which
she must post odds, in which case a confidence of .5, or perhaps
remaining entirely agnostic by not adopting any particular level of
confidence, seems more reasonable than her being fully confident
despite her ignorance.
At the least, such examples raise questions about the connection
that the DBA presupposes between partial beliefs and
favorable/unfavorable betting odds. In the case where an agent
must give her betting quotient for what is in fact a logical truth, any
value less than one leaves her vulnerable to a sure loss, possibly a
bankrupting one, yet in such cases not all such credences are
rationally on a par. The issue here seems to be more than simply
one about how well the underlying theory of action and belief works for
extreme values, but also about the relevant conception of rational
belief. Rational action-guiding credences should generally
reflect the agent’s evidence, yet at least in the cases above,
probabilism seems sometimes to require that they do not. One may
question whether the appropriate or intended sense of
‘rational’ is invoked in these cases in which it seems
right to say that rational beliefs can come apart from betting
quotients, but such objections just highlight the lack of clarity in
most presentations of the argument over what sort of rationality is
supposed to be at stake. It has been said, for instance, that it
is ideal rationality that demands adherence to the axioms, but this
notion too is unclear. What can be said though is that there are
cases in which degrees of belief do satisfy an important ideal of
rationality but where they seem to come apart from betting quotients,
and this puts additional pressure on the premise that agents should be
willing to accept bets where their degrees of belief match the betting
quotient.
Neither a forced nor a competitive betting situation per se guarantees
that incoherence will result in actual losses, and even in the special
cases in which it would bring them about, it appears that having
incoherent degrees of belief need not be irrational. Indeed,
whereas degrees of belief may generally be thought of as guides to
action, and as well-modeled by betting quotients in many cases, forced
and competitive betting situations in fact reinforce the point that
they are not always straightforwardly linked. Thus, arguments for
the claim that incoherence is generally irrational that begin with the
claim that it is irrational in forced betting situations fail to 
get off the ground, let alone show that it is irrational outside of
such situations, where the connection between incoherence and the
possibility of losses is even more tenuous. Still, forced and
competitive betting situations are helpful in identifying rational
constraints under idealized conditions, and can serve as useful models
of action in some situations. Under highly circumscribed
conditions, where the agent’s goals are limited, they show that
it is prudent to post coherent betting quotients. It is a bad feature
of incoherent betting quotients, whether or not they correspond to such
degrees of belief, that in a forced betting situation they provide the
opportunity for a clever bookie to inflict a sure loss, and guarantee
it in competitive ones with a utility-maximizing opponent. But,
the special conditions that make it rational to have coherent betting
quotients, so as to avoid a sure loss, are not met in general. In
some circumstances, a small sure loss can be better than the chance of
a greater loss. Additionally, where there is something of value
that is linked to a wager besides the stake, it can also be rational to
act so as to bring about a sure loss on a bet.
Aside from the reasons given above for the fact that it can be rational
to leave oneself open to, or act so as to guarantee, a sure loss,
situations in which the value of a bet is not fully represented by its
monetary payoff conditions present challenges for versions of the DBA
that take the problem with incoherence as stemming from the threat of
losing money. An agent may not wish to risk losing money on a
large bet, due to additional bad consequences that would or might
ensue, or the agent may suffer anxiety over the prospect of loss.
De Finetti and others insist on limiting the stakes in an effort to get
around this problem, but Ramsey already observed that one might have a
“reluctance to bother with trifles”, which is to say that
there is a negative value to placing bets with little potential
gain. Perhaps there is some range for which the stakes are
neither too high nor too low, such that the monetary payoffs may be
taken as at least a reasonable approximation of the value of the bets,
but this further limits the situations in which a sure loss may be
inflicted.
Another problem involving the value of bets arises in establishing the
additivity axiom, for even if each in a set of bets is acceptable, it
does not follow that they would be jointly acceptable. Consider a
person with 4 dollars, who needs 2 dollars for bus fare. He might
be willing to take either one of two wagers that cost 2 dollars for a
chance at winning enough money to buy a newspaper to read on the ride,
but be unwilling to risk all 4 dollars, and the possibility of having
to walk home. One response here is to insist that the bets should
be presented in terms of utilities rather than money, although this
raises difficulties of its own, since these are not objective
commodities. Such an approach involves assuming either directly
or indirectly that such utilities are additive, but even this is not
enough. While it may plausibly be argued that given a set of
credences and utilities, pragmatic rationality requires maximizing
expected value with respect to those credences and utilities, so that
an agent with incoherent degrees of belief is committed to accepting
bets (paying off in utility) that lead to a sure loss, the problem for
the DBA remains that being so committed to a sure loss is still not
necessarily irrational. See (Maher 1993).
It is clear that the version of the DBA presented in section 1.2 is far
from cogent. There is a gap between the agent’s degrees of
belief and the acceptance of bets that would produce a sure loss, and
the possibility of such a loss need not entail irrationality. One
can specify situations in which the connections are tighter, but this
fails to establish the general claim of probabilism.
A popular response to the objections to the DBA considered in section
one suggests that incoherence is not a pragmatic defect per se, and
that the Dutch Book is merely a dramatic device for illustrating a kind
of logical defect. Skyrms (1987) attributes this reading
of the DBA to Ramsey, finding support in his remarks that
Additional support for this interpretation can be found in
Ramsey’s assertion that the subject of his paper is the
logic of partial belief.
Many authors, including Armendt (1993), Christensen (1996, 2004),
Hellman (1997), Howson and Urbach (1993), and more recently Briggs
(2009) and Mahtani (2015) have endorsed and elaborated upon the idea
that violation of the probability axioms amounts to a kind of
inconsistency. For example, Armendt (1993) tells us that it involves
an inconsistency that is revealed by the fact that degrees of belief
guide action, and that Dutch Book vulnerability amounts to giving
conflicting evaluations to the same option(s). He calls this
“divided-mind” inconsistency, which he says is a flaw of
rationality. This fits the typical sort of case where an agent
violates additivity, and sometimes applies to violations of the other
axioms, but incoherence does not always entail having two different
evaluations of the same option. Although degrees of belief often serve
as guides to action, they need not be tied to an evaluation of options
at all. However, it is a fundamental assumption of most versions of
the DBA that credences do have such a role, as in the theories of
Ramsey and de Finetti, so it is of interest that even with this
assumption, incoherence need not involve giving conflicting
evaluations (Vineberg 2001). Consider for instance a person who is
less than fully confident of Fermat’s Last Theorem, perhaps
because they don’t know that it has been proven. On at least
some ways of understanding propositions, this need not entail
attaching two different judgments to the same proposition. One could
also violate coherence by only attaching a probability of less than
one to a single proposition that is a logical truth, or one could
avoid different evaluations by having the same level of confidence in
every proposition. These examples aside, even the additivity axiom is
problematic on Armendt’s interpretation, for it requires, for
mutually exclusive propositions \(p\) and \(q\), that joint bets on
\(p\) and on \(q\) amount to the same option as a bet on \(p\) or
\(q\). This in turn presumes that values are additive, which goes
beyond simply having degrees of confidence in \(p, q\), and their
disjunction, although Armendt (1993) suggests that the assumption is
generally met and appropriate for the purposes of the DBA.
In “Truth and Probability”, Ramsey assumes that, at least
under idealized conditions, degrees of belief manifest themselves in
preferences for options. This allows Ramsey to characterize the
inconsistency involved in violating the probability axioms in terms of
violating the axioms of rational preference. While he never claims that
degrees of belief are necessarily linked to preferences, the model of
belief and preference that he offers assumes such an association, and
indeed a great achievement of the paper is what amounts to a
representation theorem establishing that an agent satisfying the axioms
that he specifies for rational preference can be represented as having
degrees of belief that satisfy the probability axioms. In the
model he offers, degrees of belief serve as guides to action through
their connection with preferences, so that therein at least incoherence
does manifest itself in preference inconsistency. But the way
that Ramsey casts the inconsistency involved in violating the axioms in
terms of preference inconsistency leaves it unclear that his goal of
characterizing the logic of partial belief has been satisfactorily
met. One trouble is that it does not show us that the preference
inconsistency to which incoherent beliefs are tied is appropriately
analogous to inconsistency for simple (or full) belief, which involves
believing inconsistent propositions, i.e. a set of propositions that
cannot all be true. Another worry is that in Ramsey’s model
degrees of belief are linked with preferences, and it seems that having
a degree of belief does not by its nature require any such connection
with preference and action. One can surely have finely graded
beliefs in propositions without those beliefs being connected to preferences.
Moreover, consistency for full belief derives from the concept of
belief as holding propositions to be true and from the logic of
propositions, without any such assumed tie to action, and although
Ramsey thought that such a connection was necessary to clarify the idea
of partial belief, it seems that a fully analogous characterization of consistency
for partial belief should do without it.
Several philosophers have sought to establish coherence as a
consistency constraint on degrees of belief through a version of the
DBA that does not presuppose any definite connection between degrees
of belief and preference (Christensen 1996, 2004; Howson and Urbach
1993; Hellman 1997). These so-called depragmatized arguments
purport to improve upon Ramsey’s treatment by making clear how
coherence is supposed to mirror the ordinary notion of
consistency. Howson and Urbach attempt this by identifying an agent’s
degree of belief in \(M\) with the bets she regards as fair, such
that for credence \(q\) in \(M\), a bet with cost
$\(Sq\) that pays
is taken as fair. They then employ the Dutch Book
theorem to argue that incoherent degrees of belief cannot in fact be
fair betting quotients, and thus that incoherence involves taking a set
of bets as fair that cannot be fair, which is supposed to parallel
having inconsistent beliefs.
There are several problems that undermine Howson and Urbach’s
approach. The most basic is that an agent with degree of
belief \(q\) in \(M\) need not regard bets of the above form as
fair for a variety of reasons. To begin with she may simply lack the
concept of a fair bet. Secondly, she could have credence \(q\), yet
acknowledge the bet above as explicitly unfair. For instance, if she
knows \(M\) to be either a logical truth or a logical falsehood,
but has no idea which, her confidence that it is true could be
½, though she may well know that this would not be a fair
betting quotient for it. Casting credences in terms of the bets that
are regarded as fair is also problematic in that it appears to
associate degrees of belief with having certain full beliefs, which
some think should be avoided. The argument also clearly falters over
the additivity axiom, since even if an agent regards each of a set of
bets as individually fair, they may not be collectively fair by her
lights, so she need not evaluate the bets required to produce a book as
fair bets. Here, and in the basic assumption about the individual bets
that an agent finds fair, it is in effect assumed that money acts as a
measure of value. Not only is this not generally true, it calls
attention to the fact that the argument has not really been
depragmatized. While Howson and Urbach do not rely on either the
assumption that agents will (or should) act in accordance with their
degrees of belief or that they should be willing to accept either
direction of a fair bet, they do assume that agents make evaluations
of bets, which are tied to the concept of pragmatic value. Maher
(1997) argues that their way of spelling out fairness in terms of a
primitive concept of advantage, so as to avoid the notions of
preference and utility, fails. Indeed, it is hard to see that the
latter notions can be avoided in explicating the concept of fairness,
upon which their argument depends.
A similar argument is offered by Christensen (1996), except that his
depragmatized DBA further weakens the connection between degrees of
belief and bets. Where Howson and Urbach specify that an agent will
regard a bet as fair, Christensen assumes only that the bet is
sanctioned as fair or justified by the agent’s beliefs, thus
avoiding the first objection to Howson and Urbach’s
treatment. He then invokes the Dutch Book theorem to argue that
incoherent degrees of belief sanction as fair a set of bets that
cannot be fair, and claims this reveals that incoherence is
fundamentally an epistemic, and indeed a logical, defect. But
his argument clearly faces the previous difficulty over the additivity
axiom since, even if two bets are sanctioned individually, it does not
follow that they are sanctioned jointly. In response to this
problem, Christensen (2004) modified his argument by restricting the
assumption about the sanctioning of bets to “simple agents”
who value only money, value it linearly, etc., so that monetary payoffs
function as utilities for them. He then argued that degrees of
belief that violate the probability axioms in a simple agent are
rationally defective because they sanction bets that
would be guaranteed to lose money. From this he claimed that since it
is the incoherent beliefs themselves that have been shown to be
defective, such beliefs are rationally defective in all
agents.
Here again, the pragmatic dimension of the argument seems to have been
merely submerged. Degrees of belief do not sanction bets in
isolation from preference, and so the alleged defect in the simple
agent who violates the probability axioms cannot be pinned merely on those
beliefs. Since it is not the simple agent’s
beliefs themselves that have been shown to be defective, but rather
those beliefs in combination with her preferences, the inference that
incoherent degrees of belief are rationally defective in all agents is
invalid. For all that has been shown, such beliefs might be fine
in combination with a different preference structure. Not only is
it premature to conclude that incoherence is rationally defective
generally, Christensen has not argued convincingly that
incoherence is rationally or logically defective even in simple
agents. It could be rational for a simple agent to be incoherent
if she were surrounded by “Czech bookies”, who will offer
bets so that she is on the winning, rather than the losing, side of the
book, because in this situation incoherence will lead to satisfaction
of her one goal as a simple agent of increasing her monetary
gain. Of course it is incoherence as a logical defect, rather
than one of means/ends rationality, that is Christensen’s focus,
but since sanctioning bets as fair that cannot be fair is not a
property of incoherent credences alone, he has not shown
incoherence to be on a par with inconsistency with full belief, where
the defect lies with the beliefs themselves.
The depragmatized DBAs attempt to use the Dutch Book theorem to show
that incoherent degrees of belief involve a kind of inconsistency on
their own, irrespective of the way in which they link up with
particular preferences. But the claim of inconsistency here requires
that credences be tied to evaluations of fairness, which in turn
invokes a concept of valuation that goes beyond merely having degrees
of belief. If an agent’s degrees of belief are incoherent, and
he makes evaluations of bets using the standard expectation rule, then
there will be bets (with payoffs in some measure of utility) such that
calculated individually these will have expected value zero, and will
in this sense be fair by his lights, but which lead to a net loss, and
so may be said to be unfair. The unfairness can be deduced from the
agent’s beliefs and their connection with the agent’s
utilities, which establishes the defect brought out by the Dutch Book
as internal to the agent, marking a crucial difference between the
loss so inflicted and the sort requiring superior factual knowledge on
the part of the bookie. While the linkage between the agent’s
credences and his evaluation of bets is crucial to this result, the
needed connection is independent of the agent’s particular
preference for goods, and so it could be said that the failure to
correspond to fair betting quotients is a property of the
agent’s beliefs, as tied to evaluations of acts, yielding the
result that incoherent credences, appropriately connected with
preference, display a property that is analogous to inconsistency for
full belief.
There is then a version of the DBA that seems close to what Ramsey had
in mind, which claims that insofar as degrees of belief link up
suitably with preferences, incoherence is associated with a property
mirroring inconsistency, although this still need not amount to
divided-mind inconsistency in Armendt’s sense, nor is it entirely
akin to inconsistency for full beliefs, which are characterized
directly without any assumed connection to preference and action. The
agent by whose lights each of a set of bets looks fair although they lead
collectively to a Dutch Book, which can be set up by examining simply
the agent’s credences, has a system of evaluation that is
self-defeating, and as such may be said to exhibit a form of
irrationality. On this reading, the vulnerability associated with
incoherence is theoretical, and linked closely with the agent’s
utilities, which means that actual vulnerability depends not only upon
an appropriately situated bookie, but also upon the availability of
suitable commodities that measure those utilities. With this in
place, bets can be fixed that constitute a book on the basis of the
agent’s beliefs, but which are evaluated as fair by the
agent’s lights. Notice that the previous points, that an
agent might avoid book by refusing to bet and that one might end up on
the side of a sure gain, are now otiose, for here it is the
agent’s evaluations, rather than their consequences that are
implicated by the Dutch Book. Still, the DBA depends upon the theory of
preference and utility, and as Kaplan notes (Kaplan 1996), this does
not emerge straightforwardly from standard presentations of the
argument of the sort considered in section one, nor in the
depragmatized versions, as observed in the previous section.
The assumptions of the DBA are significant. It is the agent’s
system of credences together with the way they are involved in
evaluating options that is implicated by the Dutch Book. To conclude
that simply having incoherent credences is irrational, a further
argument is needed showing that rationality demands that credences be
linked to evaluations of bets as in the DBA, but there is little to
suggest that graded degrees of belief must be so connected. Indeed,
the DBA assumes not only that there is some connection between an
agent’s credences and the evaluation of options, but that one
should evaluate a bet as fair if it has an expected value of zero,
using one’s credences with the standard expectation rule. This
builds in that an agent’s credences are related such that for each
\(H\),
Hedden has recently called attention to this assumption, which he
terms Negation Coherence, noting that it follows from the claim that
credences satisfy finite additivity and normalization (Hedden
2013). The premise of the DBA that connects credences with fair
betting quotients thus presupposes a significant part of the
probabilist’s claim.
 

Even assuming the appropriate kind of connection between credences and evaluations of
options, it may be objected still that the sort of inconsistency
revealed through Dutch Book vulnerability is not necessarily
irrational, particularly in cases where this is due to the failure to
grasp some subtle or complex logical facts. It is hard to see
that rationality requires agents to attempt to remove such
inconsistencies in their belief systems; indeed for most it would be
both hopeless and counterproductive. Nor does it seem correct to count
as more rational the person who avoids inconsistency, by refusing to
have an opinion in the face of evidence, than the person with less than
full confidence in a logical truth, who takes the incomplete evidence
into account. One option is to insist that coherence is a
requirement on ideal agents. It might be suggested instead that
coherence is one of a number of ideals, whose satisfaction may
sometimes conflict, and that an incoherent agent may still be rational
in the sense that they have optimally managed their opinions in light
of the totality of their goals and constraints. Whatever the
conclusion about the irrationality of being incoherent though, with
idealizing assumptions about the connection between degrees of belief
and the evaluation of options, the DBA succeeds in establishing
incoherence as an evaluative defect.
Given a countable infinity of mutually exclusive and exhaustive ways
\(W_i\) in which the proposition \(A\) can be true,
the Principle of Countable Additivity requires that
A Dutch Book argument can be constructed for the principle by
extending the Dutch Book for finite additivity (Adams 1962; Jeffrey
2004; Williamson 1999) by appealing to an infinite set of bets that
each pay $1 if \(W_i\) is true for the price \(\pr(W_i)\). In the case
of the Dutch Book argument for countable additivity, there is an
additional reason beyond those for the basic argument to favor the
interpretation of it, as Jeffrey does, as establishing the principle
as a consistency constraint, since the loss is purely
theoretical. There is no threat of an actual loss to an agent since
this would require an infinite series of bets, which cannot all be
made and settled. However, the principle itself is controversial,
making the Dutch Book argument for countable additivity highly
provocative. Both de Finetti (1972) and Savage (1954) argued that the
principle should not be invoked as a constraint on rational degrees of
belief. A consequence of the principle is that it prohibits positive
credences that are uniformly distributed over a countably infinite
partition, and yet it seems at least acceptable, in the absence of a
reason to favor some possibilities over others, to adopt such a
distribution. Intuitively, a uniform distribution ought to count as
consistent, which puts pressure on the idea, at least when it comes to
countable additivity, that Dutch Books reveal a defect that is
substantially analogous to inconsistency. In the background, as with
the basic argument, the Dutch Book argument for countable additivity
makes significant assumptions about how degrees of belief are linked
with preference and assessments of value. For details concerning how
these relate to the demand that an agent’s degrees of belief
satisfy countable additivity, see (Seidenfeld and Schervish 1983).
The basic idea behind the Dutch Book argument for probabilism has been
used in defense of a variety of principles that purport to govern how
beliefs should evolve over time. In each case, it is argued that
the agent who violates the principle is subject to a Dutch Book.
Here, the bets involved are placed at different times, but there is an
algorithm for placing the bets that is available at the outset
guaranteeing a profit to one side. Such arguments are generally
referred to as “Dutch Strategy” arguments.
There is a Dutch Book (strategy) argument purporting to show that an
agent ought to change beliefs by Conditionalization, which is due to
Lewis (1999), but was first reported by Teller (1973). The Rule of
Conditionalization states that an agent with the probability function
\(\pr_1\) at time \(t_1\) who learns \(E\) and nothing stronger at
time \(t_2\) should obtain her new probability function \(\pr_2\)
from her old probability function by conditionalizing on \(E\),
i.e. for each proposition \(A\), \(\pr_2(A) = \pr_1(A\mid E)\). When
an agent violates this rule by adjusting her probabilities such that
\(\pr_2(A) \lt \pr_1(A\mid E)\), a bookie can inflict a sure loss by
first selling the agent the following three bets:
If \(E\) is false, the agent has a net loss of [\(\pr_{1}(A\mid E) -\)
\(\pr_{2}(A)\)] \(\pr_{1}(E)\). If \(E\) is true, then the
bookie buys back a fourth bet:
Bets 1 and 2 together amount to a conditional bet on \(A\), which is
called off if \(E\) is false. In the event that \(E\) is true, this bet
is bought back at the lower price of \(\pr_{2}(A)\). Bet 3
spreads the expected winnings of that exchange in order to assure a
profit in the case that \(E\) is false. Thus, if \(E\) is true the agent
suffers a net loss of [\(\pr_{1}(A\mid E) - \pr_{2}(A)\)]
\(\pr_{1}(E)\). If \(\pr_{2}(A) \gt \pr_{1}(A\mid E)\),
then the strategy involves reversing the direction of the above
bets. Where dollars are taken as measures of utility, each bet is
fair given the agent’s beliefs at the time offered.
As van Fraassen points out, the betting formula above does not yield an
argument for the diachronic Principle of Conditionalization as stated
(van Fraassen 1989). There is no strategy for the bookie that
guarantees him a profit from an agent for whom
\(\pr_{2}(A) \ne \pr_{1}(A\mid E)\)
unless
the agent makes a commitment to violate the rule in a particular way in
advance. The idea that the above bets constitute a betting
strategy yielding a Dutch Book tacitly assumes that the agent’s
deviant rule \(D\) is fixed at time \(t_{1}\), before it is known
whether or not \(E\) is true, and that the agent is sure to follow the rule
if \(E\) is learned.
However, the bookie can guarantee himself a profit in some cases
even if it is not assumed that the agent will follow though by placing
a side bet that he wins in the event that the agent does not change
beliefs as planned. The Dutch Strategy depends upon the fact that
the agent initially has some definite probability that he will shift
probabilities in the event that \(E\), in some particular way that is not
the result of conditionalization on \(E\). The Dutch Strategy
argument in no way establishes that one must have such a probability,
and so at most shows that one should not have a plan involving a fixed
probability to update upon learning \(E\) in a way that differs from
conditionalizing on \(E\).
Even where it is assumed that an agent is fully committed to following
through on some deviant rule, there are questions about what the Dutch
Strategy shows. As with the basic DBA for probabilism, it is possible
to devise scenarios in which it would be rational to leave oneself
open to a Dutch Strategy by announcing a deviant updating rule, and so
the Dutch Strategy argument should not be taken to show that it is
strictly irrational to have an updating rule other than
Conditionalization. Rather, the existence of the strategy points to a
tension in adopting such a rule. Shifting from \(\pr_{1}\) to
\(\pr_{2}\) by conditionalizing on \(E\) is equivalent to
invariance, i.e. for each proposition \(A\),
\(\pr_{1}(A\mid E) =\)
\(\pr_{2}(A\mid E)\). Adopting a rule for updating other
than Conditionalization is thus tantamount to holding at
time \(t_{1}\) that for some \(A\),
\(\pr_{1}(A\mid E) \ne\)
\(\pr_{2}(A\mid E)\). Note that the bookie simply takes
advantage of the difference between the agent’s probability for A
given \(E\) at \(t_{1}\) and
at \(t_{2}\). Where the agent is certain
at \(t_{1}\) that he would update via some deviant
rule \(D\), the rule induces a conditional probability at that time
for \(A\) given \(E\) that differs from
\(\pr_{1}(A\mid E)\). In such a case,
\(\pr_{2}(A\mid E)\) is fixed at \(t_{1}\) by
the agent’s credal state, and so given that
\(\pr_{1}(A\mid E) \ne\)
\(\pr_{2}(A\mid E)\), the agent’s credences may be said
to exhibit a kind of inconsistency. While this is more problematic
than the sort of inconsistency involved in simply having different
levels of confidence for a proposition at different times, it appears
less like inconsistency for full belief than failing to obey the
probability axioms, where the agent has evaluations according to which
each in a set of bets is fair at a single time. While
\(\pr_{2}(A\mid E)\) may be fixed at
\(t_{1}\), this is not the agent’s conditional probability
at \(t_{1}\), but rather the probability for \(A\)
given \(E\) that she will come to have at \(t_{2}\) upon
learning \(E\). Such updating plans are part of the agent’s credal
system though, for which Dutch Book vulnerability signals a
defect. The fact that there is a converse Dutch Book argument, as
Skyrms (1987b) demonstrates, shows that the trouble is avoided by adhering
to the Rule of Conditionalization, which has virtues over the sort of
diminished system of beliefs that avoids inconsistency by shunning an
updating rule.
Jeffrey proposes a further Generalized Conditionalization Rule (also
termed Probability Kinematics or Jeffrey
Conditionalization) to cover cases in which experience does not
manifest itself in some evidential proposition \(E\) shifting to
one, but rather stems from a shift in probabilities over some
partition \(\{E_{i}\}\) (Jeffrey 1983). Jeffrey’s Rule
states that
which is equivalent to the invariance condition that \(pr_1(A\mid E_i)
= pr_2(A\mid E_i)\), for each element \(E_i\) of the partition. To
maintain that updating goes by Jeffrey Conditionalization is to
mandate invariance for each proposition \(A\). This might seem to be
required, as Armendt shows that a Dutch Strategy can be constructed
against an agent who has a rule for updating that conflicts with
Jeffrey’s Rule (Armendt 1980). As with the Rule of
Conditionalization though, the Dutch Strategy does not show that there
is any problem with shifting probabilities over a partition, and then
abandoning one’s prior conditional probabilities over that
partition, that is violating invariance; the problem is with adopting
a rule of this sort in advance. As with the simple Rule of
Conditionalization, Skyrms (1987b) shows that there is also a converse
Dutch Strategy argument showing that following Jeffrey’s Rule
avoids a Dutch Book. While the Rule of Conditionalization is generally
presented as demanding that agents satisfy invariance for each
proposition, and various authors have rightly complained that this
demands an unreasonable rigidity of belief (Bacchus, Kyburg, and
Thalos 1990; Levi 2002), Jeffrey does not treat the condition as a
strict requirement on rational belief change (Jeffrey 2004). He leaves
open the possibility that when probabilities are shifted over a
partition, the conditional probabilities could change, although this
leaves the unanswered question as to when invariance is reasonable to
assume. In any case, as with the Simple Rule of Conditionalization,
the Dutch Strategy argument here tells in the same way against planned
violations of invariance.
A Dutch Strategy argument has also been given for the controversial
Principle of Reflection, which requires that for any proposition \(A\)
and any future time \(t\), an agent’s current probability for
\(A\) conditional on later assigning it probability \(r\) is itself
\(r\), that is pr \((A\mid \pr_{t}(A) = r) = r\). In violating
Reflection, the agent fails to endorse certain of her possible future
judgments, which as van Fraassen showed (van Fraassen 1984), opens the
door to a Dutch Strategy. If the agent violates Reflection in that
\(\pr(A\mid \pr_{t}(A) = r) \gt r\), the bookie sells the following
bets:
where \(x = \pr(A \mid \pr_{t}(A) = r)\).
In the event that \(\pr_{t}(A) = r\), the bookie then buys a fourth bet from
the agent on \(A\) with a prize of 1, with a price of the
agent’s new probability.
The idea that the existence of such a strategy shows that agents
should satisfy Reflection has been widely disputed, even by many who
take the Dutch Book arguments for probabilism and conditionalization
as having force. Much of the discussion stems from a variety of
counterexamples to Reflection in which it appears irrational
not to violate the principle. One example, due to Talbott, turns on
the fact that real agents lack perfect recall (Talbott 1991). He
considers a person who had spaghetti \((S)\) the previous night,
say November 16, and contemplates the probability that she will give
to her having eaten spaghetti on that day in year’s time. Since she
eats spaghetti on average one out of every ten days, she thinks it
likely that \(\pr_{t}(S) = 0\).1. But surely she
should not assign a probability of 0.1 to her having had spaghetti the
previous night conditional on the claim that
\(\pr_{t}(S) = 0\).1, since she is nearly certain
(say \(\pr_{t}(S) = 0\).99) of what she had for
dinner the previous night.
The forgetting that makes it reasonable to violate Reflection in
Talbott’s spaghetti dinner example involves one type of limited
future impairment. Christensen gives a different case in which an
agent has just consumed a mind-altering drug (LSQ) that he expects in
hour’s time will make him believe that he can fly, without
conferring upon him any such power (Christensen 1991). However,
this is the only effect of the drug, so that the agent’s
faculties will remain otherwise acute. Before the drug takes
effect, the agent should not take his probability that he can fly
conditional on his coming to believe it in an hour to be high, as
required by Reflection, because what he will think when under the
influence is irrelevant to his ability to fly. A similar example
involving Ulysses and the Sirens is discussed by van Fraassen (1995).
It is important in both of these examples that it is not only
reasonable to violate Reflection, but that to do otherwise would
involve failing to properly account for the evidence about the
unreliability of one’s future beliefs. Christensen’s
own response involves arguing that because the bets in diachronic Dutch
Book arguments are made over time, unlike in the synchronic argument
for the probability axioms, they do not reveal a form of inconsistency
that is generally irrational. One of several troubles with this
is that it would require rejecting the claim that the Dutch Strategy
against agents who plan to violate Conditionalization reveals any sort
of problematic inconsistency. Other problems with Christensen’s
response are discussed in (Vineberg 1997).
Others have tried to respond to the counterexamples by distinguishing
features of the Dutch Strategy argument for Reflection that do not
involve dismissing all diachronic Dutch Book arguments. For
instance, Hitchcock emphasizes that it is important to consider what
the bookie knows in assessing the relevance of Dutch Books on an
agent’s rationality (Hitchcock 2004). He observes that
unlike the case in which an agent violates the probability axioms, and
the bookie can determine and place the bets with only the knowledge of
the agent’s beliefs, in Talbott’s example, the bookie may
need to exploit information that is unavailable to the agent in order
to make the Dutch Book. 
Taking into account what a bookie needs to know in order to guarantee
himself a profit fails to distinguish adequately between the Dutch
Books that appear to be norms of rationality and those that do
not. First, as Hitchcock acknowledges, this won’t work to
resolve the tension between the Dutch Strategy argument for Reflection
and many of the other counterexamples. In Christensen’s
example, taking LSQ does not have any effect on memory, it merely
changes the agent’s evaluation of his ability to fly, that is, he
changes his view of a very limited bit of evidence, so that the Dutch
Strategy can be carried out without the bookie having relevant
information that the agent does not.
Still, perhaps we might take the fact that book can be made without
having knowledge beyond that of the agent as at least a necessary
condition for a telling book. Various cases, besides that of the
spaghetti dinner, give plausibility to the idea that a Dutch Book only
establishes the unreasonableness of violating a particular principle
when the book is made with no special knowledge not possessed by the
agent. Consider an agent who violates the probability axioms in
virtue of failing to recognize some complicated logical truth.
Arguably this is not unreasonable, and setting up a Dutch Book in this
case would require knowledge that the agent lacks. But, insofar
as the irrationality in violating the axioms stems from the fact that
it is supposed to be a form of inconsistency, as both Hitchcock and
Christensen maintain, then the fact that a bookie might need (logical)
knowledge that the agent lacks in order to set up the book, is
irrelevant to whether the book has force. Whether an
agent’s beliefs are inconsistent, unlike the question of
whether she is to be regarded as reasonable, is independent of what she
or anybody else knows. 
Briggs offers another way of distinguishing those Dutch Books that
mark the violation of a genuine norm from those that do not (Briggs
2009). Her contention is that whereas the Dutch Strategy argument for
Conditionalization reveals what she terms incoherence, which she takes
to be a form of inconsistency, the Dutch Strategy argument for
Reflection reveals merely self-doubt, which involves an agent who
suspects herself of incoherence. Briggs assumes that an agent’s
credences “condone” accepting certain bets as fair, and
that an agent’s credences admit of a Dutch Book just in case
those credences condone a set of bets that yield a net loss to the
agent in every world where the agent has those credences and
accordingly would condone the bets. Violating the probability axioms,
Conditionalization or Reflection makes one vulnerable to a Dutch Book
in this sense. Briggs observes that the bets in the Dutch Books that
may be constructed against someone violating either the probability
axioms or Conditionalization will yield a net loss in every possible
world; but, the bets in the Dutch Strategy against the violator of
Reflection will not result in a loss in certain worlds in which the
agent’s beliefs differ from those that she has in the actual
world. Accordingly, Briggs suggests that incoherence is marked by
Dutch Books that involve bets that result in a loss in every world,
and thus that violation of Reflection does not involve incoherence.
This way of attempting to save the Dutch Strategy argument for
Conditionalization, while jettisoning that for Reflection, is
criticized by Mahtani, who argues that Briggs’ test mistakenly
counts certain cases of mere self-doubt as incoherence (Mahtani
2012). Recently, she proposed a new way of understanding Dutch Book
arguments as revealing incoherence, according to which an agent is
incoherent if and only if she would accept as fair a set of bets that
would result in a loss under any interpretation of the claims involved
(Mahtani 2015). With this understanding, violation of the probability
axioms reveals incoherence, but violations of Reflection and cases of
self-doubt in which the agent isn’t sure of her own credences do
not count as incoherence, as they do not involve proper Dutch Books
that result in a loss under any interpretation. As she discusses, this
way of understanding Dutch Books leaves it open as to whether there is
a proper Dutch Book argument for Conditionalization.
 
Both Briggs and Mahtani extract the condition of incoherence from the
features of certain bets, though it remains unclear as to how
precisely the concept of incoherence, in their sense, is to be
understood, i.e. how it is supposed to be analogous to
inconsistency. Still, the discussion is important for there is some
intuition that violating Reflection is less similar to holding
inconsistent beliefs than violating the probability axioms. When it
comes to Conditionalization, Briggs takes the full principle as
established by a Dutch Book argument, which as previously discussed
appears too strong, since the consistency required by rationality does
not seem to require having a plan for updating. Indeed, precisely what
sort of inconsistency is involved in cases where one is susceptible to
a Dutch Strategy on account of having an alternative updating rule to
Conditionalization remains unclear, and is perhaps a point in favor of
Mahtani’s analysis upon which the status of Conditionalization
remains inconclusive.
Both proposals must contend with the subtle connection between
credences and bets. Mahtani associates credences with bets that the
agent would accept as fair, but as previously noted, having credences
need not go along with accepting bets as fair in the way needed to
connect the violation of various probabilistic norms with a Dutch
Book. While Briggs acknowledges that there is a complex relationship
between credences and bets, her notion that credences condone certain
bets also appears to be in the spirit of the depragmatized DBAs,
which, as observed, suffer from various difficulties. The significance
of distinguishing between different types of Dutch Books so as to mark
off some as pointing to a form of incoherence is unclear.  Whereas one
or the other of their proposals may comport better with our intuitions
about what is intuitively incoherent (or inconsistent), if we retain
Ramsey’s idea of credences as guides to action, then either way
of distinguishing between Dutch Books looks problematic, since any
credences that lead to a sure loss are, at least to some extent,
defective as a guide to action. 
An interesting application of Dutch Strategy arguments has been made
by Hitchcock to the perplexing Sleeping Beauty problem (Hitchcock
2004). In the problem, Beauty is to undergo an experiment in which she
will be put to sleep on Sunday night, after which a fair coin will be
tossed. If it comes up heads, she will be awakened just once for a
short time on Monday, and if tails she will also be awakened again on
Tuesday. In each case, after being awakened, she will be put back to
sleep with drugs that will erase her memory of having been awake. On
Wednesday, she is awakened and the experiment ends. Beauty is aware of
these facts about the experiment, so that when she wakes up during the
experiment she will not know whether it is Monday or Tuesday. The
problem is to determine what her probability should be for heads upon
awakening within the experiment. Elga introduced the problem into the
philosophical literature (Elga 2000), and argued that upon awakening
Beauty should shift her probability from the value of \(\bfrac{1}{2}\)
that she assigned on Sunday night to \(\bfrac{1}{3}\). Lewis argued
shortly thereafter that Beauty’s probability upon awakening
should remain at \(\bfrac{1}{2}\) (Lewis 2001), and additional
arguments have followed on both sides. Hitchcock shows that there is a
Dutch Strategy against either answer, but then argues that there is
only force to the one against Beauty if she sticks with
\(\bfrac{1}{2}\).
The strategies serve as potential counterarguments to the two ways of
answering the problem, rather than showing that it is irrational to
switch to \(\bfrac{1}{3}\) or stick with \(\bfrac{1}{2}\) per se, since the individual
strategies depend upon the plan to have a particular probability upon
awakening. If Beauty plans to switch to probability \(\bfrac{1}{3}\) for heads,
the Dutch Strategy is just an application of the general strategy
against someone who violates Reflection. Hitchcock argues that
this would not establish Beauty’s irrationality, since in this
case the bookie must know during the experiment what day it is in order
to implement the strategy, which is information that Beauty
lacks. On the other hand, if Beauty sticks with \(\bfrac{1}{2}\), a strategy
can be carried out without the bookie having to know more than Beauty
by having the bookie undergo the experiment with her and offer a bet
against heads on Sunday and a bet on heads whenever Beauty and the
bookie awake within the experiment. If the coin lands heads, the
bookie sells Beauty just one bet on heads, with her gain totaling less
than her loss on the first bet against heads. If the coin lands
tails, the bookie sells a bet on heads once on Monday and the same bet
again on Tuesday, so as to again produce a loss for Beauty.
Hitchcock takes this book to tell against the answer \(\bfrac{1}{2}\), and in favor
of \(\bfrac{1}{3}\).
One trouble with defending the answer of \(\bfrac{1}{3}\) in this way
is that what a bookie must know to assure himself a profit does not
characterize what is essential to a proper Dutch Book. There is also a
particular reason to suppose that Beauty’s predicament is one in
which reasonable degrees of belief and betting quotients can come
apart, because the third bet needed to make book in the switching case
is only offered when it is sure to be a losing bet (discussed in
Vineberg 2004—see the Other Internet Resources, and Bradley and
Leitgeb 2006). In this case the bookie exploits features of the
experiment, so that the strategy can be carried out without his
possessing knowledge of the day. But the fact that the bets leading to
book are triggered by the circumstances suggests that it is not just
Beauty’s beliefs on which the strategy depends, and hence the
loss does not reflect a purely internal defect, despite the fact that
the bookie can implement the strategy without having access during the
experiment to knowledge that Beauty lacks. Draper and Pust also argue
that Hitchcock’s use of a Dutch Book argument is subject to an
objection from evidential decision theory (Draper and Pust 2008).
Dutch Books have also been used to show that there are limitations on
the proper applications of credences within the standard decision
theoretic framework. Given that the available evidence often appears
to dictate only vague or interval-valued credences, it has been argued
that rationality permits having such unsharp credences. Elga uses a
kind of reverse Dutch Book involving a series of bets that are sure to
result in a net gain for the agent to argue that credences must be
sharp (Elga 2010). The idea is that a rational agent must accept at
least one of the bets in the series, but that there does not appear to
be a satisfactory set of decision rules for unsharp credences with
this consequence.
McGee constructs another type of Dutch Book with implications for
decision theory. Suppose that an agent’s probability function is
not concentrated at finitely many points. Such a state of opinion, in
which the agent does not rule out all but a finite number of
possibilities, seems both consistent and reasonable, yet assuming that
an agent’s utilities are unbounded, McGee shows that there is an
infinite series of bets, each with positive expected value, which
together assure a loss (McGee 1999). Assuming that it is reasonable to
have probabilities that are not concentrated at finitely many points,
McGee calls into question the general adequacy of the decision
theoretic framework, and in particular the principle of utility
maximization that his Dutch Book argument presumes.
It remains defensible that the Dutch Book argument shows that the
probability axioms are something like consistency constraints on
partial belief, at least given some substantial decision-theoretic
assumptions, unlike the idea that their violation is a pragmatic
liability. But this interpretation is less successful for the various
other norms for which Dutch Book arguments have been constructed. The
Dutch Strategy arguments for the Principle of Conditionalization and
for Jeffrey’s Rule do not fully support the norms, but only the
weaker claim that one should not commit in advance to following an
alternative rule, and the sense in which it may be said to be
inconsistent to do so seems different from what is involved in
violating the axioms. The other claims considered here for which Dutch
Book arguments have been constructed are even less plausibly regarded
as consistency constraints, and thus seem to be a different sort of
requirement on ideal rationality.  This suggests the need to identify
‘consistency’ with a narrower set of conditions than mere
Dutch Book vulnerability, if we are not to abandon the idea of the
probability axioms as a consistency constraint that extends the
ordinary concept and, perhaps, reject the DBA altogether. A more
fine-grained analysis of the various Dutch Books might yield a way of
marking off those that point to genuine inconsistency from those
exhibiting some other sort of defect. Briggs and Mahtani take steps in
this direction, but questions remain about the adequacy of their
approaches.
