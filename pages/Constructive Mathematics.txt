Before mathematicians assert something (other than an axiom) they are
supposed to have proved it true. What, then, do mathematicians mean
when they assert a disjunction \(P \vee Q\),
where \(P\) and \(Q\) are syntactically correct statements
in some (formal or informal) mathematical language? A natural —
although, as we shall see, not the unique — interpretation of
this disjunction is that not only does (at least) one of the
statements \(P, Q\) hold, but also we can decide which
one holds. Thus just as mathematicians will assert
\(P\) only when they have decided that \(P\) holds by
proving it, they may assert \(P \vee Q\) only when
they either can produce a proof of \(P\) or else produce one of
\(Q\).
With this interpretation, however, we run into a serious
problem in the special case where \(Q\) is the negation,
\(\neg P\), of \(P\). To assert \(\neg P\) is to
show that \(P\) implies a contradiction (such as \(0 = 1)\). But it will
often be that mathematicians have neither a proof of \(P\) nor
one of \(\neg P\). To see this, we need only reflect on the
following Goldbach conjecture (GC):
Every even integer \(\gt 2\) can be written as a sum of two
primes,
which remains neither proved nor disproved despite the best efforts
of many of the leading mathematicians since it was first raised in a
letter from Goldbach to Euler in 1742. We are forced to conclude that,
under the very natural decidability interpretation of P
\(\vee Q\), only a stubborn optimist can retain a belief in the law of
excluded middle (LEM): 
For every statement \(P\), either \(P\) or \(\neg P\) holds.
Classical logic gets round this by
widening the interpretation of disjunction: it interprets \(P \vee Q\)
as \(\neg(\neg P\wedge \neg Q)\), or in other words, “it is
contradictory that both \(P\) and \(Q\) be false”. In turn, this
leads to the idealistic interpretation of existence, in which
\(\exists xP(x)\) means \(\neg \forall x\neg P(x)\) (“it is
contradictory that \(P(x)\) be false for every \(x\)”). It is on
these interpretations of disjunction and existence that mathematicians
have built the grand, and apparently impregnable, edifice of classical
mathematics which serves a foundation for the physical, the social,
and (increasingly) the biological sciences. However, the wider
interpretations come at a cost: for example, when we pass from our
initial, natural interpretation of \(P \vee Q\) to the unrestricted
use of the idealistic one, \(\neg(\neg P\wedge \neg Q)\), the
resulting mathematics cannot generally be interpreted within
computational models such as recursive function theory.
This point is illustrated by a well-worn example, the
proposition:
There exist irrational numbers \(a, b\) such that \(a^b\) is
rational.
A slick classical proof goes as follows. Either
\(\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\) is rational, in which case we take \(a = b =
\sqrt{2}\); or else \(\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\) is irrational, in which
case we take \(a = \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\) and \(b = \sqrt{2}\) (see
Dummett 1977 [2000], 6). But as it stands, this proof does not enable
us to pinpoint which of the two choices of the pair \((a,b)\) has the
required property. In order to determine the correct choice of
\((a,b)\), we would need to decide whether \(\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\)
is rational or irrational, which is precisely to employ our initial
interpretation of disjunction with \(P\) the statement
“\(\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\) is rational”.
Here is another illustration of the difference between
interpretations. Consider the following simple statement about the set
\(\bR\) of real numbers:
where, for reasons that we divulge shortly, \(x \ne 0\) means that we
can find a rational number \(r\) with \(0 \lt r \lt \abs{x}\). A
natural computational interpretation of (*) is that we have a
procedure which, applied to any real number \(x\), either tells us
that \(x = 0\) or else tells us that \(x \ne 0\). (For example, such a
procedure might output 0 if \(x = 0\), and 1 if \(x \ne 0\).) However,
because the computer can handle real numbers only by means of finite
rational approximations, we have the problem of underflow, in
which a sufficiently small positive number can be misread as 0 by the
computer; so there cannot be a decision procedure that justifies the
statement (*). In other words, we cannot expect (*) to hold under our
natural computational interpretation of the quantifier \(\forall\) and
the connective \(\vee\).
Let’s examine this from another angle. Let \(G(n)\) act as
shorthand for the statement “\(2n + 2\) is a sum of two
primes”, where \(n\) ranges over the positive integers, and
define an infinite binary sequence \(\ba = (a_1 ,a_2,\ldots)\)
as follows:
There is no question that \(\ba\) is a computationally
well-defined sequence, in the sense that we have an algorithm for
computing \(a_n\) for each \(n\): check the even numbers
\(4,6,8,\ldots ,2n+2\) to determine whether each of them is a sum of
two primes; in that case, set \(a_n = 0\), and in the contrary case,
set \(a_n = 1\). Now consider the real number whose \(n\)th
binary digit is \(a_n\):
If (*) holds under our computational interpretation, then we can
decide between the following two alternatives:
In the latter case, by testing \(a_1 ,\ldots ,a_N\), we can find \(n
\le N\) such that \(a_n = 1\). Thus the computational interpretation
of (*) enables us to decide whether there exists \(n\) such that \(a_n
= 1\); in other words, it enables us to decide the status of the
Goldbach Conjecture. An example of this type, showing that a
constructive proof of some classical result \(P\) would enable us to
solve the Goldbach conjecture (and, by similar arguments, many other
hitherto open problems, such as the Riemann hypothesis), is called
a Brouwerian example for, or even a Brouwerian
counterexample to, the statement \(P\) (though it is not a
counterexample in the normal sense of that word).
The use of the Goldbach Conjecture here is purely dramatic. For, the argument of the preceding paragraph can be modified to show
that, under our computational interpretation, (*) implies
the limited principle of omniscience (LPO):
For each binary sequence \((a_1 ,a_2, \ldots)\) either \(a_n = 0\) for
all \(n\) or else there exists \(n\) such that \(a_n = 1\),
which is generally regarded as an essentially nonconstructive
principle for several reasons. First, its recursive
interpretation,
There is a recursive algorithm which, applied to any recursively
defined binary sequence \((a_1 ,a_2, \ldots)\), outputs 0 if \(a_n =
0\) for all \(n\), and outputs 1 if \(a_n = 1\) for some \(n\),
is provably false within recursive function theory, even with
classical logic (see Bridges & Richman [1987], Chapter 3); so if we
want to allow a recursive interpretation of all our mathematics, then
we cannot use LPO. Secondly, there is a model theory (Kripke models)
in which it can be shown that LPO is not constructively derivable
(Bridges & Richman [1987], Chapter 7).
It should, by now, be clear that a full-blooded computational
development of mathematics disallows the idealistic interpretations of
disjunction and existence upon which most classical mathematics
depends. In order to work constructively, we need to return
from the classical interpretations to the natural constructive
ones:
These BHK-interpretations (the name reflects their origin in
the work of Brouwer, Heyting, and Kolmogorov) can be made more precise
using Kleene’s notion of realizability; see (Dummett
[1977/2000], 222–234; Beeson [1985], Chapter VII).
What sort of things are we looking for if we are serious about
developing mathematics in such a way that when a theorem asserts the
existence of an object \(x\) with a property \(P\), then the proof of
the theorem embodies algorithms for constructing \(x\) and for
demonstrating, by whatever calculations are necessary, that \(x\) has
the property \(P\). Here are some examples of theorems, each followed
by an informal description of the requirements for its constructive
proof.
Proof requirement: An algorithm which, applied to a given
real number \(x\), decides whether \(x = 0\) or \(x \ne 0\). Note
that, in order to make this decision, the algorithm might use not only
the data describing \(x\) but also the data showing that \(x\) is
actually a real number.
Proof requirement: An algorithm which, applied to a set
\(S\) of real numbers, a member \(s\) of \(S\), and an
upper bound for \(S\),
Proof requirement: An algorithm which, applied to the
function \(f\), a modulus of continuity for \(f\), and the values
\(f(0)\) and \(f(1)\), 
Proof requirement: An algorithm which, applied to the
function \(f\), a modulus of continuity for \(f\), the values
\(f(0)\) and \(f(1)\), and a positive number \(\varepsilon\), 
We already have reasons for doubting that (A) has a constructive
proof. If the proof requirements for (B) can be fulfilled, then, given
any mathematical statement \(P\), we can apply our proof of (B)
to compute a rational approximation \(z\) to the supremum \(\sigma\)
of the set
with error \(\lt \bfrac{1}{4}\). We can then determine whether \(z \gt
\bfrac{1}{4}\), in which case \(\sigma \gt 0\), or \(z \lt
\bfrac{3}{4}\), when \(\sigma \lt 1\). In the first case, there exists
\(x \in S\) with \(x \gt 0\), so we must have \(x = 1\) and therefore
\(P\). In the case \(\sigma \lt 1\), we have \(\neg P\). Thus (B)
implies the law of excluded middle.
However, in Bishop’s constructive theory of the real numbers, based on
Cauchy sequences with a preassigned convergence rate, we can prove the
following constructive least-upper-bound principle:
In passing, we mention an alternative development of the constructive
theory of \(\bR\) based on interval arithmetic; see Chapter
2 of Bridges & Vîță [2006].
Each of statements (C) and (D), which are classically equivalent, is
a version of the Intermediate Value Theorem. In these statements, a
modulus of continuity for \(f\) is a set \(\Omega\) of ordered
pairs \((\varepsilon ,\delta)\) of positive real numbers with the following
two properties:
Statement (C) entails another essentially nonconstructive principle, the lesser limited principle of
omniscience (LLPO):
For each binary sequence \((a_1,a_2,\ldots)\) with at most one term
equal to 1, either \(a_n = 0\) for all even \(n\) or else \(a_n = 0\)
for all odd \(n\).
Statement (D), a weak form of (C), can be proved constructively,
using an interval-halving argument of a standard type. The following
stronger constructive intermediate value theorem, which suffices for
most practical purposes, is proved using an approximate-interval-halving argument:
Let \(f\) be a continuous real-valued mapping on the closed interval
\([0,1]\) such that \(f(0)\cdot f(1) \lt 0\). Suppose
also that \(f\) is locally nonzero, in the sense that for
each \(x \in [0,1]\) and each \(r \gt 0\), there exists \(y\) such
that \(\abs{x - y} \lt r\) and \(f(y) \ne 0\). Then there exists \(x\)
such that \(0 \lt x \lt 1\) and \(f(x) = 0\).
The situation of the intermediate value theorem is typical of many
in constructive analysis, where we find one classical theorem with
several constructive versions, some or all of which may be equivalent
under classical logic.
There is one omniscience principle whose constructive status is less
clear than that of LPO and LLPO—namely, Markov’s
principle (MP):
For each binary sequence \((a_n)\), if it is contradictory that all
the terms \(a_n\) equal 0, then there exists a term equal to
1.
This principle is equivalent to a number of simple classical
propositions, including the following:
Markov’s principle represents an unbounded search: if you have a
proof that all terms \(a_n\) being 0 leads to a contradiction, then,
by testing the terms \(a_1,a_2,a_3,\ldots\) in turn, you are
guaranteed to come across a term equal to 1; but this
guarantee does not extend to an assurance that you will find the
desired term before the end of the universe. Most practitioners of
constructive mathematics view Markov’s principle with at least
suspicion, if not downright disbelief. Such views are reinforced by
the observation that there is a Kripke Model showing that MP is not
constructively derivable (Bridges & Richman [1987],
137–138.)
The desire to retain the possibility of a computational
interpretation is one motivation for using the constructive
reinterpretations of the logical connectives and quantifiers that we
gave above; but it is not exactly the motivation of the pioneers of
constructivism in mathematics. In this section we look at some of the
different approaches to constructivism in mathematics over the past 130
years.
In the late nineteenth century, certain individuals—most
notably Kronecker and Poincaré—had expressed doubts about, or even disapproval of, the idealistic, nonconstructive methods used by
some of their contemporaries; but it is in the polemical writings of
 L.E.J. Brouwer
 (1881–1966), beginning with his
Amsterdam doctoral thesis, Brouwer [1907], and continuing over the next
forty-seven years, that the foundations of a precise, systematic
approach to constructive mathematics were laid. In Brouwer’s
philosophy, known as intuitionism, mathematics is a free
creation of the human mind, and an object exists if and only if it can
be (mentally) constructed. If one takes that philosophical stance, then
one is inexorably drawn to the foregoing constructive interpretation of
the logical connectives and quantifiers: for how could a proof of the
impossibility of the non-existence of a certain object \(x\)
describe a mental construction of \(x\)?
Brouwer was not the clearest expositor of his ideas, as is shown by
the following quotation:
A modern version of Brouwer’s view was given by Errett Bishop (Bishop
[1967], p. 2): 
However obscure Brouwer’s writings could be, one thing was always
clear: for him, mathematics took precedence over logic. One might say,
as Hermann Weyl did in the following passage, that Brouwer saw
classical mathematics as flawed precisely in its use of classical logic
without reference to the underlying mathematics: 
In particular, this misuse of logic led to nonconstructive existence
proofs which, in Weyl’s words, “inform the world that a
treasure exists without disclosing its location”. 
In order to describe the logic used by the intuitionist
mathematician, it was necessary first to analyse the mathematical
processes of the mind, from which analysis the logic could be
extracted. In 1930, Brouwer’s most famous pupil, Arend Heyting,
published a set of formal axioms which so clearly characterise the
logic used by the intuitionist that they have become universally known
as the axioms for
 intuitionistic logic
 (Heyting [1930]). These axioms captured the informal
BHK-interpretation of the connectives and quantifiers that
we gave earlier.
Intuitionistic mathematics diverges from other types of constructive
mathematics in its interpretation of the term “sequence”.
Normally, a sequence in constructive mathematics is given by a rule
which determines, in advance, how to construct each of its terms; such
a sequence may be said to be lawlike or
predeterminate. Brouwer generalised this notion of a sequence
to include the possibility of constructing the terms one-by-one, the
choice of each term being made freely, or subject only to certain
restrictions stipulated in advance. Most manipulations of sequences do
not require that they be predeterminate, and can be performed on these
more general free choice sequences.
Thus, for the intuitionist, a real number \(\bx = (x_1
,x_2,\ldots)\)—essentially, a Cauchy sequence of rational
numbers—need not be given by a rule: its terms \(x_1
,x_2,\ldots\), are simply rational numbers, successively constructed,
subject only to some kind of Cauchy restriction such as the following
one used by Bishop [1967]:
Once free choice sequences are admitted into mathematics,
so, perhaps to one’s initial surprise, are certain strong choice
principles. Let \(P\) be a subset of \(\bN^{\bN} \times \bN\) (where
\(\bN\) denotes the set of natural numbers and, for sets \(A\) and
\(B, B^A\) denotes the set of mappings from \(A\) into \(B)\), and
suppose that for each \(\ba \in \bN^{\bN}\) there exists \(n \in \bN\)
such that \((\ba,n) \in P\). From a constructive point of view, this
means that we have a procedure, applicable to sequences, that computes
\(n\) for any given \(\ba\). According to Brouwer, the construction of
an element of \(\bN^{\bN}\) is forever incomplete: a generic sequence
\(\ba\) is purely extensional, in the sense that at any given
moment we can know nothing about \(\ba\) other than a finite set of
its terms. It follows that our procedure must be able to calculate,
from some finite initial sequence \((a_0 ,\ldots ,a_N)\) of terms of
\(\ba\), a natural number \(n\) such that \(P(\ba,n)\). If \(\bb \in
\bN^{\bN}\) is any sequence such that \(b_{k} = a_{k}\) for \(0 \le k
\le N\), then our procedure must return the same \(n\) for \(\bb\) as
it does for \(\ba\). This means that \(n\) is a continuous function of
\(\ba\) with respect to the topology on \(\bN^{\bN}\) given by the
metric 
We are therefore led to the following principle of continuous
choice, which we divide into a continuity part and a choice part. 
CC1 : Any function from \(\bN^{\bN}\) to
\(\bN\) is continuous. 
CC2 : If \(P \subseteq \bN^{\bN} \times \bN\), and for each
\(\ba \in \bN^{\bN}\) there exists \(n \in \bN\) such that \((\ba,n) \in
P\), then there is a function \(f : \bN^{\bN} \rightarrow \bN\) such
that \((\ba,f(\ba)) \in P\) for all \(\ba \in \bN^{\bN}\).
If \(P\) and \(f\) are as in CC2, then we say that \(f\) is a
choice function for \(P\).
The omniscience principles LPO and LLPO are demonstrably false under
the hypotheses CC1–2; but MP is consistent with it. Among the
remarkable consequences of CC1–2 are the following.
 
exists. Then there exists \(c \gt 0\) such that \(\lVert u_n (x)\rVert
\le c\) for all \(n\in \bN\) and all unit vectors \(x\) of \(X\)
(Uniform boundedness principle).
Each of these statements appears to contradict known classical
theorems. However, the comparison with classical mathematics should
not be made superficially: in order to understand that there is no
real contradiction here, we must appreciate that the meaning of such
terms as “function” and even “real number” in
intuitionistic mathematics is quite different from that in the
classical setting. (In practice, intuitionistic mathematics cannot be
compared, readily and directly, with classical mathematics.)
Brouwer’s introspection over the nature of functions and the
continuum led him to a second principle, which, unlike that of
continuous choice, is classically valid. This principle requires a
little more background for its explanation.
For any set \(S\) we denote by \(S^*\) the set of all finite sequences
of elements of \(S\), including the empty sequence \((\ )\). If
\(\alpha = (a_1 ,\ldots ,a_n)\) is in \(S^*\), then \(n\) is called
the length of \(\alpha\) and is denoted by
\(\abs{\alpha}\). If \(m \in \bN\), and \(\alpha\) is a finite or
infinite sequence in \(S\) of length at least \(m\), then we denote by
\(\bar{\alpha}(m)\) the finite sequence consisting of the first \(m\)
terms of \(\alpha\).  Note that \(\bar{\alpha}(0) = (\ )\) and \(\abs{\bar{\alpha}(0)}\) = 0 . If
\(\alpha \in S^*\) and \(\beta = \bar{\alpha}(m)\) for some \(m\), we
say that \(\alpha\) is an extension of \(\beta\), and that
\(\beta\) is a restriction of \(\alpha\).
A subset \(\sigma\) of \(S\) is said to be detachable
(from \(S)\) if
A detachable subset \(\sigma\) of \(\bN^*\) is called a fan
if
is finite or empty, where \(\alpha^* n\) denotes the
finite sequence obtained by adjoining the natural number \(n\) to
the terms of \(\alpha\).
A path in a fan \(\sigma\) is a sequence \(\alpha\), finite
or infinite, such that \(\bar{\alpha}(n) \in \sigma\) for each
applicable \(n\). We say that a path \(\alpha\) is blocked by
a subset \(B\) if some restriction of \(\alpha\) is in \(B\); if no
restriction of \(\alpha\) is in \(B\), we say that \(\alpha\)
 misses \(B\). A subset \(B\) of a fan
\(\sigma\) is called a bar for \(\sigma\) if each infinite path of
\(\sigma\) is blocked by \(B\); a bar \(B\) for \(\sigma\) is
uniform if there exists \(n \in \bN\)
such that each path of length \(n\) is blocked by \(B\).
At last we can state Brouwer’s next principle of
intuitionism, the fan theorem for detachable
bars (FT\(_D\)):
 Every detachable bar of a fan is uniform.
In its classical contrapositive form, FT\(_D\) is known as
König’s Lemma: if for every \(n\) there exists a
path of length \(n\) that misses \(B\), then there exists an
infinite path that misses \(B\) (see Dummett 1977 [2000],
49–53). (Of course, classically the condition of detachability
is superfluous.) It is simple to construct a Brouwerian counterexample
to König’s Lemma.
Brouwer actually posited the fan theorem without the restriction of
detachability of the bar. Attempts to prove that more general fan
theorem constructively rely on an analysis of how we could know that a
subset is a bar, and led Brouwer to a notion of bar
induction; this is discussed in Section 3.6 of the entry
 on intuitionism in the philosophy of mathematics;
 another good reference for bar induction is van Atten (2004).
 We shall return to fan theorems in Section 4.
Of the many applications of Brouwer’s principles, the most famous is
his uniform continuity theorem (which follows from the
pointwise continuity consequences of CC1-2 together a form of fan
theorem more general than FT\(_D)\):
The reader is warned once again to interpret this carefully within
Brouwer’s intuitionistic framework, and not to jump to the erroneous
conclusion that intuitionism contradicts classical mathematics. It is
more sensible to regard the two types of mathematics as incomparable.
For further discussion, see the entry on
 intuitionistic logic.
Unfortunately — and perhaps inevitably, in the face of
opposition from mathematicians of such stature as Hilbert —
Brouwer’s intuitionist school of mathematics and philosophy became more
and more involved in what, at least to classical mathematicians,
appeared to be quasi-mystical speculation about the nature of
constructive thought, to the detriment of the practice of constructive
mathematics itself. This unfortunate polarisation between the
Brouwerians and the Hilbertians culminated in the notorious
Grundlagenstreit of the 1920s, details of which can be found in the
Brouwer biographies by van Dalen [1999, 2005] and van Stigt [1990].
In the late 1940s, the Russian mathematician A.A. Markov began the
development of an alternative form of constructive mathematics (RUSS),
which is, essentially,
 recursive function 
theory with intuitionistic
logic (Markov [1954], Kushner [1985]). In this variety the objects are
defined by means of Gödel-numberings, and the procedures are all
recursive; the main distinction between RUSS and the classical
recursive analysis developed after the work of Turing,
Church, and others in 1936 clarified the nature of computable processes is
that the logic used in RUSS is intuitionistic.
One obstacle faced by the mathematician attempting to come to grips
with RUSS is that, being expressed in the language of recursion
theory, it is not easily readable; indeed, on opening a page of
Kushner’s excellent lectures [1985], one might be forgiven for
wondering whether this is analysis or logic. (This remark should be
tempered with reference to the two relatively readable books on
classical recursive analysis by Aberth [1980, 2001].) Fortunately, one
can get to the heart of RUSS by an axiomatic approach due to Richman
[1983] (see also Chapter 3 of Bridges & Richman [1987]).
First, we define a set \(S\) to be countable if there
is a mapping from a detachable subset of \(\bN\) onto
\(S\). With intuitionistic logic we cannot prove that every
subset of \(\bN\) is detachable (the reader is invited to provide a
Brouwerian example to demonstrate this). Countable subsets of \(\bN\)
in Richman’s axiomatic approach are the counterparts of recursively
enumerable sets in the normal development of RUSS.
By a partial function on \(\bN\) we
mean a mapping whose domain is a subset of \(\bN\); if the
domain is \(\bN\) itself, then we call the function a
total partial function on \(\bN\). Richman’s
approach to RUSS is based on intuitionistic logic and a single axiom
of computable partial functions (CPF):
There is an enumeration \(\phi_0 ,\phi_1,\ldots\) of the set of all
partial functions from \(\bN\) to \(\bN\) with countable
domains.
It is remarkable what can be deduced cleanly and quickly using this
principle. For example, we can prove the following result, which almost
immediately shows that LLPO, and hence LPO, are false in the recursive
setting. 
Of more interest, however, are results such as the following within
RUSS. 
From a classical viewpoint, these results fit into place when one
realises that words such as “function” and “real
number” should be interpreted as “recursive
function” and “recursive real number”
respectively. Note that the second of the above four recursive
theorems is a strong recursive counterexample to the open-cover
compactness property of the (recursive) real line; and the fourth is a
recursive counterexample to the classical theorem that every uniformly
continuous mapping of a compact set into
\(\bR\) attains its infimum.
Progress in all varieties of constructive mathematics was relatively
slow throughout the next decade and a half. What was needed to raise
the profile of constructivism in mathematics was a top-ranking
classical mathematician to show that a thoroughgoing constructive
development of deep analysis was possible without a commitment to
Brouwer’s non-classical principles or to the machinery of recursive
function theory. This need was fulfilled in 1967, with the appearance
of Errett Bishop’s monograph Foundations of Constructive
Analysis [1967], the product of an astonishing couple of years in
which, working in the informal but rigorous style used by normal
analysts, Bishop provided a constructive development of a large part of
twentieth-century analysis, including the Stone-Weierstrass Theorem,
the Hahn-Banach and separation theorems, the spectral theorem for
self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space, the Lebesgue convergence
theorems for abstract integrals, Haar measure and the abstract Fourier
transform, ergodic theorems, and the elements of Banach algebra theory.
(See also Bishop & Bridges [1985].) Thus, at a stroke, he gave the
lie to the commonly-held view expressed so forcefully by Hilbert: 
Not only did Bishop’s mathematics BISH have the advantage
of readability — if you open Bishop’s book at any page,
what you see is clearly recognisable as analysis, even if, from time
to time, his moves in the course of a proof may appear strange to one
schooled in the use of the law of excluded middle — but, unlike
intuitionistic or recursive mathematics, it admits many different
interpretations. Intuitionistic mathematics, recursive constructive
mathematics, and even classical mathematics all provide models of
BISH. In fact, the results and proofs in BISH can be interpreted, with
at most minor amendments, in any reasonable model of computable
mathematics, such as, for example, Weihrauch’s Type Two
Effectivity Theory (Weihrauch [2000]; Bauer [2005]). 
How is this multiple interpretability achieved? At least in part by
Bishop’s refusal to pin down his primitive notion of
“algorithm” or, in his words, “finite routine”.
This refusal has led to the criticism that his approach lacks the
precision that a logician would normally expect of a foundational
system. However, this criticism can be overcome by looking more closely
at what practitioners of BISH actually do when they prove theorems: in practice,
they are doing mathematics with intuitionistic logic.
Experience shows that the restriction to intuitionistic logic always
forces mathematicians to work in a manner that, at least informally,
can be described as algorithmic; so algorithmic mathematics appears
to be equivalent to mathematics that uses only intuitionistic
logic. If that is the case, then we can practice constructive
mathematics using intuitionistic logic on any reasonably defined
mathematical objects, not just some class of “constructive
objects”.
This view, more or less, appears to have first been put forward by
Richman [1990, 1996]. Taking the logic as the primary characteristic of
constructive mathematics, it does not reflect the primacy of
mathematics over logic that was part of the belief of Brouwer, Heyting,
Markov, Bishop, and other pioneers of constructivism. On the other
hand, it does capture the essence of constructive mathematics in
practice.
Thus one might distinguish between the ontological
constructivism of Brouwer and others who are led to constructive
mathematics through a belief that mathematical objects are mental
creations, and the epistemological constructivism of Richman
and those who see constructive mathematics as characterised by its
methodology, based on the use of intuitionistic logic. Of course, the
former approach to constructivism inevitably leads to the latter; and
the latter is certainly not inconsistent with a Brouwerian
ontology.
To do actual mathematics we need more than just
intutionistic logic. For Bishop, the building blocks of mathematics
were the positive integers (see the quote from Bishop [1967] in Section
3.1 above). Among the early formal systems for BISH
were Myhill’s [1975] axiomatic foundation based on
primitive notions of number, set, and function; Feferman’s
[1975] system for explicit mathematics; and Friedman’s
[1977] intuitionistic ZF set theory. The two most favoured formal underpinnings of BISH at this stage
are the CZF set theory
of Aczel and Rathjen [2000], and the
 intuitionistic type theory of Martin-Löf [1975, 1984].
Before ending our tour of varieties of modern constructive
mathematics, we visit a fourth variety, based on Per Martin-Löf’s
intuitionistic type theory (ML). 
Martin-Löf published his Notes on
Constructive Mathematics [1968], based on lectures he had given in
Europe in 1966–68; so his involvement with constructivism in
mathematics goes back at least to the period of Bishop’s writing
of Foundations of Constructive Analysis. Martin-Löf’s
book is in the spirit of RUSS, rather than BISH; indeed, its author
did not have access to Bishop’s book until his own manuscript was
finished. Martin-Löf later turned his attention to his theory of
types as a foundation for Bishop-style constructive mathematics. 
Here, in his own words, is an informal explanation of the ideas
underlying ML:
In particular, in this system every proposition can be represented as a
type: namely, the type of proofs of the proposition. Conversely, each
type determines a proposition: namely, the proposition that the type in
question is inhabited. So when we think of a certain type \(T\) as a
proposition, we interpret the formula 
as “\(x\) is a proof of the proposition \(T\)”. 
Martin-Löf goes on to construct new types, such as Cartesian
products and disjoint unions, from old. For example, the Cartesian
product
is the type of functions that take an arbitrary object \(x\) of type \(A\)
into an object of type \(B(x)\). In the
propositions-as-proofs interpretation, where \(B(x)\)
represents a proposition, the above Cartesian product corresponds to
the universal proposition
Martin-Löf distinguishes carefully between proofs and derivations: a
proof object is a witness to the fact that some proposition
has been proved; whereas a derivation is the record of the
construction of a proof object. Also, he exercises two
basic forms (one dare not say “types” here) of
judgement. The first is a relation between proof objects and
propositions, the second a property of some propositions. In the first
case, the judgement is either one that a proof object \(a\) is a
witness to a proposition \(A\), or else one that two proof objects
\(a\) and \(b\) are equal and both witness that \(A\)
has been proved. The first case of the second form of judgement states
that a proposition \(A\) is well-formed, and the second records
that two propositions \(A\) and \(B\) are equal.
 There is a careful, and highly detailed, set of rules for
formalising ML. We will not go into those here, but refer the reader
to other sources such as Sambin &
Smith [1998].
When actually doing constructive mathematics in type theory, one often
needs to equip completely presented sets (types) with an equivalence
relation, the combination being known as a setoid. Mappings
are then functions that respect those equivalence relations. This is in
close agreement with the way Bishop presented his informal theory of
sets. The dependent types of Martin-Löf are useful for
constructing subsets. For instance, the real numbers can be
constructed using the \(\Sigma\)-type (see Martin-Löf [1984]):
An element of this type \(B\) is thereby a pair consisting of a
convergent sequence \(\bx\) of rationals and a proof \(p\) that
it is convergent. A suitable equivalence relation \({\sim}\) on \(R\)
is defined by taking \((x,p)\sim(y,q)\) to mean
The resulting setoid of real numbers is \(\bR =
(R,{\sim})\). We can readily prove that
and then, using the type-theoretic axiom of choice (see Section 4
below), find a function \(f : \bR\rightarrow \bZ\) such that \(f(x)
\lt x \lt f(x)+2\). However, there is no reason to believe that the
function \(f\) respects the equivalence relations—that is, that
\(f(x) = f(y)\) holds if \(x \sim y\).
 Every constructive proof embodies an algorithm that, in principle,
can be extracted and recast as a computer program; moreover, the
constructive proof is itself a verification that the algorithm is
correct — that is, meets its specification. One major advantage
of Martin-Löf’s formal approach to constructive mathematics is
that it greatly facilitates the extraction of programs from proofs.
This has led to serious work on the implementation of constructive
mathematics in various locations (see Martin-Löf [1980], Constable
[1986], Hayashi & Nakano [1988], Schwichtenberg [2009]). Some recent implementations of
type theory for proof extraction are Coq and Agda (see the links in
Other Internet Resources).
The full axiom of choice can be stated as follows:
If \(A,B\) are inhabited sets, and \(S\) a subset of \(A \times B\)
such that
then there exists a choice function \(f : A \rightarrow B\) such that 
Now, if this is to hold under a constructive interpretation, then for
a given \(x \in A\), the value \(f(x)\) of
the choice function will depend not only on \(x\) but also on
the data proving that \(x\) belongs to \(A.\) In
general, we cannot expect to produce a choice function of this
sort. However, the BHK interpretation of the hypotheses in the axiom
is that there is an algorithm
 \(\mathcal{A}\)
 which, applied to any given
\(x \in A\), produces an element
\(y \in B\) such that \((x,y)
\in S\). If \(A\) is a completely presented set, one
for which no work beyond the construction of each element in the set
is required to prove that the element does indeed belong
to \(A\), then we might reasonably expect the algorithm
 \(\mathcal{A}\) to be a choice function. In
 Martin-Löf’s type theory, every set is completely
 presented and, in keeping with the BHK interpretation, the axiom
 of choice is derivable.
On the other hand, in Bishop-style mathematics, completely
presented–––or, in his terminology,
basic–––sets are rare, one example being
\(\bN\); so we might expect that the axiom of choice would
not be derivable. In fact, as was shown by Diaconescu [1975] and
Goodman & Myhill [1978], and prefigured by Bishop himself in
Problem 2 on page 58 of Bishop 1967, the axiom of choice implies the
law of excluded middle. Clearly, the Diaconescu-Goodman-Myhill theorem
applies only under the assumption that not every set is completely
presented.
Constructive mathematicians not working in ML typically reject the
full axiom of choice but embrace the axiom of countable choice, in
which the domain of choice is \(\bN\), and dependent
choice. But some prefer to work without even countable choice, on the
grounds that to speak of an infinity of choices without giving a rule
presents a difficulty that is just as great whether or not the
infinity is denumerable. Interestingly, Lebesgue made precisely this
point in a letter to Borel (see Moore [2013], page 316): 
The effect of abandoning even countable choice is the exclusion of
many theorems that, as they stand, are proved using sequential,
choice-based arguments. But those who advocate avoiding choice would
argue that avoiding choice forces you to formulate things better.
A particular case of interest is the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra:
every complex polynomial has at least one root in the complex
plane. Richman [2000] has shown that without countable choice, although we
can construct only isolated (possibly multiple) roots, we
can construct arbitrarily close approximations to the multiset of
roots. Such an approach focusses on finding an approximate linear
factorization of the polynomial, rather than on finding separate
approximations to each of its roots.
For further analysis of the axiom of choice in set theory and type theory see
Martin-Löf [2006], and the SEP entries on 
 category theory,
type theory, and 
intuitionistic type theory.
In the 1970s, Harvey Friedman initiated a research programme of
reverse mathematics, aiming to classify mathematical theorems
according to their equivalence to one of a small number of
set-theoretic principles (Friedman 1975). This classification reveals
interesting, sometimes remarkable, differences in proof-theoretic
complexity. For example, although the Ascoli-Arzelà theorem is
used in the standard proof of Peano’s existence theorem for solutions
of ordinary differential equations (Hurewicz [1958], page 10), a
reverse-mathematical analysis shows that the former is equivalent to a
strictly stronger set-theoretic principle than the one equivalent to
Peano’s theorem (Simpson [1984], Theorems 3.9 and 4.2). The standard
treatise on classical reverse mathematics is (Simpson [1999/2009]).
Around the turn of this century, Veldman (see Other Internet Resources), in the
Netherlands, and Ishihara [2005, 2006], in Japan,
independently initiated a programme of constructive reverse
mathematics (CRM), based on intuitionistic, rather than
classical, logic. (Note, though, that the first published work in the
modern era of CRM is probably that of Julian and Richman [1984], which
was twenty years ahead of its time.) In this section of the article,
we describe a less formal approach to CRM, in the style and framework
of BISH. The aim of that CRM program is to classify the theorems in
the three standard models—CLASS, INT, and RUSS—according
to which principles we must, and need only, add to BISH in order to
prove them.
We stress that we restrict ourselves here to informal
CRM, in which we take for granted the principles
of function- and set-construction described in the first chapters
of Bishop [1967] or Bishop & Bridges [1985], and we work in the informal,
though rigorous, style of the practising analyst, algebraist,
topologist, … .
In practice, CRM splits naturally into two parts. In the first of
these, we consider a theorem \(T\) of INT or RUSS, and try to
find some principle, valid in that model and other than \(T\)
itself, whose addition to BISH is necessary and sufficient for a
constructive proof of \(T\). In the second part of CRM we deal
with a theorem \(T\) of CLASS that we suspect is nonconstructive,
and we try to prove that \(T\) is equivalent, over BISH, to one
of a number of known essentially-nonconstructive principles, such as
MP, LLPO, LPO, or LEM. For an example of this part of CRM, we mention
our earlier proof that the classical least-upper-bound principle
implies, and hence is equivalent to, LEM.
Incidentally, there is a strong argument for Brouwer [1921] being the first
to deal with reverse-mathematical ideas: his Brouwerian
counterexamples (see the one using the Goldbach conjecture, in Section
1 above) lie squarely in the second
part of CRM. Even if Brouwer did not state those examples as logical
equivalences, but as implications of the type
it is hard to believe that he was unaware that the right-hand-side
implied the left in such cases.
To illustrate the first part of CRM, we now concentrate on
theorems of the type
where FT\(_?\) is some form of Brouwer’s fan
theorem, and \(T\) is a theorem of INT. To do
so, we need to distinguish between certain types of bar for
the complete binary fan \(2^*\) (the set of
all finite sequences in \(\{0,1\})\).
Let \(\alpha \equiv (\alpha_1 ,\alpha_2, \ldots)\) be a finite or
infinite binary sequence. The concatenation of \(\alpha\)
with another string \(\beta\) is
For \(b\) in \(\{0,1\}\) we write \(\alpha^{\frown}b\) rather than
\(\alpha^{\frown}(b)\).  By a \(\mathsf{c}\)-subset of
\(2^*\) we mean a subset \(B\) of \(2^*\) such that
for some detachable subset \(D\) of \(2^*\). Every detachable subset
of \(2^*\) is a \(\mathsf{c}\)-subset. On the other hand, by a
\(\Pi^{0}_1\)-subset of \(2^*\) we mean a subset \(B\) of
\(2^*\) with the following property: there exists a detachable subset
\(S\) of \(2^* \times \bN\) such that
and
Every \(\mathsf{c}\)-subset \(B\) of \(2^*\) is a
\(\Pi^{0}_1\)-subset: simply take \(S = D \times \bN\), where \(D\) is a
detachable subset of \(2^*\) such that (1) holds.
If \(?\) denotes a property of subsets of \(2^*\), then
Brouwer’s fan theorem for \(?\)-bars
tells us that every bar with the property \(?\) is a uniform bar. We are
particularly interested in the fan theorem for detachable
bars (already discussed in Section 3.1):
FT\(_D\): Every detachable bar of the complete binary fan is uniform;
the fan theorem for \(\mathsf{c}\)-bars (that is, bars that
are \(\mathsf{c}\)-subsets):
FT\(_{\mathsf{c}}\): Every c-bar of the complete binary fan is uniform;
the fan theorem for \(\Pi^{0}_1\)-bars (that is, bars that
are \(\Pi^{0}_1\)-subsets):
FT\(_{\Pi^{0}_1}\): Every \(\Pi^{0}_1\)-bar of the complete binary fan
is uniform;
and the full fan theorem:
FT: Every bar of the complete binary fan is uniform.
Note that, relative to BISH,
FT \(\Rightarrow\) FT\(_{\Pi^{0}_1} \Rightarrow\) FT\(_c \Rightarrow\) FT\(_D\).
Lubarsky and Diener [2014] have shown that these implications are strict.
Typically, we want to prove that FT\(_?\) is equivalent, over
BISH, to the proposition that, for every set \(S\) of an
appropriate sort, some pointwise property of the form
actually holds uniformly in the form
Our strategy for attacking this problem is two-fold. First, given a
set \(S\) of the appropriate sort, we construct a ?-subset \(N\) of
\(2^*\) such that
This, though, is only half of the solution. To prove that the
implication from (3) to (2) implies FT\(_?\), we consider a ?-subset
\(B\) of \(2^*\) and construct a corresponding set \(S\) such that
The canonical example of such results is that of Julian and Richman
[1984], in which \(S\) is the set of values of a given uniformly
continuous mapping \(f : [0,1] \rightarrow \bR, T\) is the set of
positive real numbers, and
The pointwise property we consider is
its uniform version being
The Julian-Richman results are as follows.
Theorem 1: 
Let \(f : [0,1] \rightarrow \bR\) be uniformly continuous. Then there
exists a detachable subset \(B\) of \(2^*\) such that
Theorem 2: 
Let \(B\) be a detachable subset of \(2^*\). Then there exists a
uniformly continuous \(f : [0,1] \rightarrow \bR\) such that
The proofs of these two theorems are subtle and tricky; see Julian &
Richman [1984].
The two Julian-Richman theorems together reveal that, relative to
BISH, the fan theorem FT\(_D\) is equivalent to
the positivity principle, POS:
Each positive-valued, uniformly continuous function on \([0,1]\) has a
positive infimum.
It follows that POS is derivable in INT, in which the full fan
theorem, not just FT\(_D\), is a standard
principle. The situation is quiet the opposite in RUSS, where there
exist both a detachable bar of \(2^*\) that is not uniform and a
positive-valued, uniformly continuous function on \([0,1]\) that has
infimum equal to 0; see Chapters 5 and 6 of Bridges & Richman
[1987].
Berger and Ishihara [2005] have taken a different, indirect route to
establishing the equivalence of POS and FT\(_c\). They
establish a chain of equivalences between POS,
FT\(_c\), and four principles of the type “if there is
at most one object with property \(P\), then there is one such
object”. The four unique-existence principles are:
CIN!:   Each descending sequence of inhabited
closed located subsets of a compact metric space with at most one
common point has inhabited intersection (Cantor’s intersection theorem
with uniqueness.) Note that a subset \(S\) of a metric space \((X,\rho)\) is located if for each \(x\) in \(X\) the infimum distance from \(x\) to \(S\) exists.
MIN!:   Each uniformly continuous,
real-valued function on a compact metric space with at most one
minimum point has a minimum point.
WKL!  Each infinite tree with at most one
infinite branch has an infinite branch (the weak König lemma with
uniqueness).
FIX!:   Each uniformly continuous function
from a compact metric space into itself with at most one fixed point
and with approximate fixed points has a fixed point.
In, for example, the last of these, we say that a map \(f\) of a
metric space \((X,\varrho)\) into itself
A major open problem in CRM is that of finding a form of the fan
theorem that is equivalent, over BISH, to the uniform continuity
theorem for \([0,1]\),
UCT\(_{[0,1]}\): Every pointwise continuous mapping of \([0,1]\) into \(\bR\) is
uniformly continuous,
the proposition for which Brouwer originally developed his proof of
the fan theorem. (Note that UCT\(_{[0,1]}\) is equivalent,
relative to BISH, to the general uniform continuity theorem for metric
spaces: Every pointwise continuous mapping of a complete, totally
bounded metric space into a metric space is uniformly continuous. See, for example,
Loeb [2005].)
It follows from results of Berger [2006] that
BISH \(\vdash\) UCT\(_{[0,1]}\Rightarrow\) FT\(_c\).
Also, Diener and Loeb (2008) have proved that
BISH \(\vdash\) FT\(_{\Pi^{0}_1} \Rightarrow\) UCT\(_{[0,1]}\).
However, we do not know if either of these implications can be
replaced by a bi-implication. Perhaps UCT\(_{[0,1]}\), and hence
the full uniform continuity theorem for compact metric spaces, is
equivalent, relative to BISH, to some natural, but as yet
unidentified, version of the fan theorem.
For additional material on the fan theorem in constructive reverse
mathematics, see, for example, Berger & Bridges [2007]; Diener [2008, 2012]; Diener & Loeb [2009]; and Diener & Lubarsky
[2014]. In Dent [2013], there is a clear, though complex, diagram
illustrating the interconnections between fan theorems, continuity,
and omniscience principles (see Other Internet Resources).
Interested readers may pursue the topic of constructive reverse
mathematics in greater detail in the following supplementary
document:
Constructive mathematicians have tended to concentrate their efforts
on the field of analysis, with considerable success—witness the
wealth of functional analysis developed in Bishop [1967]. This does not
mean that, for example, algebra has been sidelined from the
constructive enterprise: the material in the monograph by Mines et al
[1986] can be regarded as a substantial algebraic counterpart to the
constructive analysis carried out by Bishop. Much more recently,
Lombardi and Quitté [2011] have published the first large
volume of a proposed two-volume work on constructive algebra. However,
not being expert in algebra, and being aware of the danger of making
this article too long to hold the reader’s attention, we choose not to
discuss constructive analysis or algebra in any detail; rather, in the
following supplementary document, we turn to constructive topology,
describing some rather different approaches to that subject:
Investigations in constructive mathematical economics date back to
a series of papers on preference,
utility, and demand from 1982 onwards; see Bridges [1999]. In his doctoral
thesis, Hendtlass [2013] substantially weakened the conditions for the
existence of a demand function; he also produced a wealth of results
in fixed-point theory and its applications, in particular to
constructivisations of two classical proofs of the existence of an
economic equilibrium.
In 2015, Berger and Svindland began a research project on
constructive mathematical finance, at
Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität in Munich.They first showed that
the fundamental theorem on asset pricing, the separating hyperplane
theorem, and Markov’s Principle are constructively equivalent (Berger
& Svindland [2016]). Their more recent work has concentrated on how
to circumvent the nonconstructivity of the classical extreme value
theorem in order to prove the existence of extreme points for
functions in the presence of even relatively weak convexity properties
(Berger & Svindland [2016a]). Their project suggests that
mathematical finance, like mathematical economics, may be a rich
source of elegant, practical constructive theorems.
The traditional route taken by mathematicians wanting to analyse the
constructive content of mathematics is the one that follows classical
logic; in order to avoid decisions, such as whether or not a real
number equals 0, that cannot be made by a real computer, the
mathematician then has to keep within strict algorithmic boundaries
such as those formed by recursive function theory. In contrast, the
route taken by the constructive mathematician follows intuitionistic
logic, which automatically takes care of computationally inadmissible
decisions. This logic (together with an appropriate set- or
type-theoretic framework) suffices to keep the mathematics within
constructive boundaries. Thus the mathematician is free to work in the
natural style of an analyst, algebraist (e.g., Mines et al.
[1988]), geometer, topologist (e.g., Bridges & Vîță
[2011], Sambin forthcoming), or other normal mathematician, the only
constraints being those imposed by intuitionistic logic. As Bishop and
others have shown, the traditional belief promulgated by Hilbert and
still widely held today, that intuitionistic logic imposes such
restrictions as to render the development of serious mathematics
impossible, is patently false: large parts of deep modern mathematics
can be, and have been, produced by purely constructive
methods. Moreover, the link between constructive mathematics and
programming holds great promise for the future implementation and
development of abstract mathematics on the computer.
