The Geluk interpretation of the Middle Way offers a unique
presentation of the Buddhist doctrine of two truths: the ultimate
truth and conventional (or relative) truth. Geluk philosophy primarily
aims to overcome reifications of the ultimate truth and denials of
conventional truths, as conventional existence and ultimate
nonexistence are intimately bound together. In this tradition, the
relationship between the two truths is said to be “essentially
the same but conceptually distinct” (ngo bo gcig la ldog pa
tha dad). That is, the two truths are not really different, but
can be distinguished conceptually, like an impermanent phenomenon and
a product. The following two claims characterize the Geluk
school’s distinctive interpretation of the two truths: (1) to
exist is to be empty and (2) to exist is to exist conventionally (see
Changkya in Cozort 1998, 429).
The ultimate truth has no positive content in the Geluk tradition;
it is simply the lack of essence in any phenomena: “The ultimate
truth is posited as solely the negation of truth [that is, inherent
existence] upon a subject that is a basis of negation…”
(Tsongkhapa, 396). Thus, no ultimate truth is affirmed (or rather,
nothing is claimed to exist ultimately). This lack of essence in phenomena, or
“emptiness,” does not annul their appearance. Rather,
emptiness is held to be the condition for the possibility for any
appearance. To be empty means to arise dependently—to lack
independent, real existence. Since nothing can be found to be
independent, everything is said to be empty. Thus, in the Geluk
tradition, emptiness is the nature of all phenomena (or their
lack of independent nature), and all phenomena are necessarily
empty.
The ultimate truth is said to be emptiness because things are not
found to exist separate from their parts, causes, or designations; this
non-finding itself is the meaning of emptiness. Emptiness, too, is not
“found” when sought (emptiness is empty, too). To be found
(when an ultimate essence is sought) is to be intrinsically or
ultimately real, and nothing has this status for the Geluk tradition,
not even emptiness.
Emptiness is interpreted in the Geluk tradition as a non-implicative
negation (med dgag). As opposed to a negation that implies
something else, a non-implicative negation is simply an absence, such
as a lack of true existence. This mere lack or absence, as a negation
of essence that implies nothing, is the meaning of the ultimate truth
in the Geluk tradition. Nevertheless, the claim that there is nothing
ultimately true—or that the ultimate truth is
“emptiness,” a null set—is a (conventional) truth,
not a truth ultimately, because nothing is ultimately true. Thus,
conventional truths are the only types of affirmative truths there are
(other than the absence of true existence) (Jinpa 2002, 46–48).
The summit of Geluk philosophy is the Consequence School. The
Consequence School is a branch of the Middle Way tradition that
radically undermines any and all foundations. The Consequence School
gets its name from the form of reductio argument used to
demonstrate emptiness, in contrast to formal (autonomous)
arguments. According to Tsongkhapa, a formal argument for emptiness is
not able to convey the meaning of emptiness (to someone who has not
understood it) because formal arguments presuppose essences. That is,
a formal argument presumes that a subject matter is objective or
given, and this cannot be the case, particularly when an anti-realist
(who understands emptiness) and a realist (who lacks an understanding
of emptiness) engage in dialogue (Changkya in Cozort 1998, 451). This is
because a proponent of the Consequence School consents to no such
given, objective facts.
For the Consequence School, a valid argument for emptiness, like
“the table is empty because it is dependent,” is not an
objective truth. The reason for this is simply because there are no
objective truths; there is nothing given. That is, the rules of logic,
even when followed, are just rules without any intrinsic reality or
objective status to ground their truth outside those rules (Jinpa 2002,
63–69). Moreover, perception is not foundational in this system.
Neither perception nor inference is foundational in the Middle Way:
perceptions validate inferences and inferences validate perceptions;
neither has priority as both simply function to sustain a consensual
reality.
By invoking consensus as the mark of (conventional) reality, the Geluk
school’s coherence theory of truth anticipates some of the insights of
the later Wittgenstein (see Thurman 1980). There are no foundations in
the Geluk tradition, neither ultimate nor conventional; there is only
transactional usage—“what is renowned in the world.”
Thus, unlike some other Middle Way philosophies, like the Autonomy
School (svātantrika), there is no “correct”
or “incorrect” relative truth, for no independent means
exists that could verify a truth claim to be a “correct”
relative truth. “What works” is the criterion; that is,
what conforms to the ways of the world is a conventional truth in the
way that a game works when you subscribe to its rules. Any further
notion of a “correct” relative implicates a foundation, an
essentialist presumption about the way things are (Changkya 1998, 321;
Bötrül 2011, 141). Therefore, the measure of what is correct is
simply what conforms to the world rather than based on any other
warrant that would serve as a deeper structure or more fundamental
layer of reality beyond what is simply conventional (Cozort 1998, 52).
A key point to Tsongkhapa’s Consequence School is that nothing exists
on its own even conventionally (Tsongkhapa 1988, 585). Thereby, there
is no need to ground conventions in any deeper foundation. Without the
need for conventional foundations—like a foundational
consciousness or self-awareness—there is no need for ultimate
foundations, either, as if a real ultimate were needed to ground
unreal conventions. When there is nothing but groundless
conventions—all the way up and all the way down—the
ultimate and the conventional are no longer separate; the two truths
are none other than two aspects of the same thing. Thereby, the two
truths are not only without contradiction, but are mutually
supportive, and this is a key to Tsongkhapa’s interpretation of the
Consequence School of the Middle Way.
Another essential point of Tsongkhapa’s Consequence School is that
distinctions within the conventional—between truth and falsity,
existence and non-existence, real and unreal—are not objective;
that is, they are not determined from objects themselves. Conventional
distinctions between what is real and unreal are made in terms of the
world. That is to say, these distinctions are not made based on any
real differences in objects themselves; rather, what constitutes what
is real and unreal is intersubjective. Significantly, what is
intersubjective necessarily incorporates a subjective dimension.
One might think that if objective distinctions are not accepted in the
Consequence School, then this position would be not different from the
subjective idealism of the reviled “Mind-Only”
school. Rather than claim that the mind is independently real in
contrast to unreal external objects, like a subjective idealist, a
proponent of the Middle Way explicitly affirms the interdependency of
minds and objects. Following Candrakīrti, a nineteenth-century
scholar, Künzang Sönam (1823–1905), unpacks
Tsongkhapa’s interpretation when he describes how minds and
external objects are equally existent in worldly convention (and in
Abhidharma) and equally nonexistent when their nature is sought in
analysis (and in a sublime being’s meditative equipoise). He goes on
to show how external objects are accepted conventionally in the
Consequence School because the coextensive presence and absence of
objects and cognitions undermines the claim that even conventionally
there are no external objects. That is, when there are external
objects, there are internal cognitions, and when there are internal
cognitions, there are external objects; cognitions and objects are
paired and thus rise and fall together. He reiterates this point by
saying that not only does no conventional analysis negate external
objects, but that conventional analysis undermines the absence of
externality (Künzang 2007, 706-707).
Elaborating on the difference between the Middle Way and Mind-Only,
Künzang Sönam says that “the distinction of whether or
not external objects are asserted or not conventionally comes down to
the acceptance of something existing on its own (rang mtshan gyis
grub pa).” This is the main issue for Tsongkhapa’s
unique interpretation of the Consequence and undergirds his claims. He
argues that proponents of Mind-Only are not satisfied with assenting
to the external world as it is proclaimed by the world; they think
that if there were external objects, they would have to be the types
of things that would be findable upon analysis, and existing
separately from cognition. Yet since there are no such things, they
deny them. The Consequence School, in contrast, asserts external
objects without these criteria, namely, without there being any
objective basis of designation for these claims. Thus, proponents of
the Consequence School simply assent to external objects in accord
with the ways of the world, and this is due to the fact that they do
not accept anything existing on its own (rang mtshan gyis grub
pa), neither an external or an internal world, even
conventionally (Künzang 2007, 707).
Künzang Sönam clarifies Tsongkhapa’s claim that
external objects are asserted in the Consequence School by arguing
that it is not at all like the assertions of those who come to affirm
external objects based on ontological analysis. This is because the
Consequence School rejects the kind of realism that is implicated by
the acceptance of an analytically determined external world. Rather,
external objects are simply accepted (conventionally) in the
Consequence School in accord with the ways of the world, without
(ontological) analysis (Künzang 2007, 707).
There is a subtle distinction to be made here that can easily be
overlooked.  One might think that since the external world is affirmed
in the Consequence School, then it is one that accepts external
realism. Perhaps some in the Geluk tradition may fall into this camp,
but this need not be the case when the affirmation of an external
world is understood as an assertion that is made from her own
perspective as to the status of an external world in reality. Rather,
it is simply a claim that conforms to intersubjective agreement
determined by mundane convention. In any case, ultimately there is no
external world for the Consequence School, so while they may not be
idealists, they are certainly not external realists, either.  That is,
proponents of the Consequence School are not external realists despite
claiming the reality of an external world because they acknowledge
that the external world does not stand on its own, even
conventionally; like minds and objects, an external world rises and
falls together with an internal world.
While the “foundational consciousness” (kun gzhi rnam
shes) and self-awareness (rang rig) are keystones for
idealist systems of Buddhist philosophy to get beyond what is merely
conventional, the Consequence School does not follow suit. In fact,
foundationalists and idealists that deny the reality of an external
world are targets of the Consequence School. The Consequence School
squarely rejects idealism. It does not assent to any independent means
to verify the claims of idealism (or physicalism for that
matter). Rather than denying an external world, external objects are
acknowledged to exist as long as internal minds are counterposed with
them. Thus, neither objects nor minds have a privileged status in this
tradition.
Self-awareness (rang rig), as distinct from
object-awareness (gzhan rig), ascribes to the mental a unique
way that a mind knows itself, a way that is different from the way a
mind knows any other object. Geluk scholars deny any special status to
self-awareness; the mind is simply a dependently arisen phenomenon,
just like any other one. Moreover, nothing appears the way it really is
to an ordinary being (Jamyang Zhepa in Hopkins 2003, 930). For this
reason, this philosophy does not partake in ordinary phenomenology.
Instead, it is primarily concerned with critical ontology, or what we
could call a form of “ontological deflationism,” in that it
aims to undermine the foundations of the entire ontological project
(MacKenzie 2008, 197). 
In the Geluk tradition, self-awareness is rejected as a notion that
attributes to the mind a special status as an independently existent
entity, and this idea is seen as one that hypostasizes the mind. One
reason for this is that a unique, first-personal access to
self-awareness, being simply given in experience, presumes that there
are grounds for immediate access to truth, and nothing has that status
for Tsongkhapa. For his Geluk tradition, conventional truths are always
mediated and contingent. Geluk scholars argue that self-awareness,
understood as a form of epistemologically primary, private knowledge,
is not necessary to account for mind and memory. They do not entertain
the notion of self-awareness understood phenomenologically either, as
some sort of nonthetic, intransitive cognition, as this concept is seen
as simply another reification.  Moreover, such a notion offers no
explanatory power in the realms of either the conventional or ultimate
truth. 
Not only does Tsongkhapa deny the existence of self-awareness, but
also the notion of a “foundational consciousness” separate
from mental consciousness. The foundational consciousness is another
Buddhist concept that often serves as a substrate for the self, one
that reifies personal identity. The notion of the foundational
consciousness is an attempt for Buddhists to account for personal
causality without affirming a real self. Tsongkhapa dispenses with this
notion of a substrate consciousness and sees it as simply another
reification, another conceptually constructed essence that masquerades
as the primary reality of the self. Instead of a foundational
consciousness, Tsongkhapa posits “the entity of
disintegration” (zhig pa’i dngos po) to account for
causality (Hopkins 2003, 934–35). The “entity of
disintegration” is his attempt to offer a coherent causal process
in the absence of real entities.
The impetus for the theory of the entity of disintegration, or so it
seems, is to provide an account for causality in the absence of
foundations. That is, disintegration is said to function like other
entities in the absence of real entities. With no real entities, an
entity’s disintegration—which is typically held within Buddhist
philosophical systems to be a non-entity—is thus attributed with
the same status as an efficacious entity (nominal). That is, both an
entity and its disintegration are nothing more than nominal
designations. While injecting disintegration with causal power is an
attempt to preserve a nominalist theory of causality, this theory
invites other problems, such as the reification of absence (i.e.,
treating emptiness as a “thing”), which has been a
frequent target for critics of the Geluk tradition.



Along with positing the entity of disintegration, among the unique
features of the Consequence School are that the foundational
consciousness and self-awareness are not only denied ultimate
existence, but are held to not exist even conventionally.
Conventional truths are always subject to rational analysis; when their
conventional status is analyzed, no such self-awareness or foundational
consciousness is analytically found, and when analyzed in terms of
their ultimate status, they are found to be groundless like every other
phenomenon. Tsongkhapa claims that the denial of true existence
even conventionally is a unique feature of the Consequence School
(Cozort 1998, 60). This is because he holds that the claim to uncover a
deeper foundation of conventional existence beyond transactional truth
is a back door to essentialist ultimate presuppositions. Thus,
not only ultimate foundations, but even conventional
foundational theories are repudiated in his Consequence School.


Despite the important role of absence in the Geluk tradition,
emptiness—the absence of essence—does not refer to total negation,
but refers in particular to the negation of the ultimate
status of a phenomenon. That is, conventional phenomena are denied
existence ultimately, not conventionally. Significantly, the denial of
self, too, does not mean the denial of the “mere self”
(bdag tsam), or the conventionally existent self (Jinpa 2002, 71).
The mere self (trimmed away of metaphysical baggage or conceptual
reification) is unapologetically affirmed by the Geluk tradition. That
is, the characteristically Buddhist denial of self is interpreted to
refer only to mistaken conceptions of self – such as that of a
permanent, singular, or truly existing entity – not the self
simpliciter. The mere self, like the mere table or
chair (i.e., the table or chair apprehended without the overlay of true
existence), is unequivocally claimed to exist. Conventional
existence, what undeniably functions within the transactional world, is
not negated. Rather, it is reification or true existence that is
denied.


The Geluk tradition’s unapologetic affirmation of conventional
reality, including the self, is a point of contention with other
schools, who argue that their philosophy simply affirms the status quo
and thus cannot accommodate a means to revise or transform the world or
one’s relation to it. Yet the Geluk tradition holds that it is
precisely the denial of essences, which are superimposed on the
conventional world or elsewhere, that leads to true transformation and
liberation.
4. Buddhist Context of Geluk Philosophy


It is important to recognize how Geluk philosophy is embedded within a
distinctively Buddhist soteriology. That is, the truth of no-self is
liberating because understanding this is held to free one from the
mistaken idea of a self that binds one to suffering. Knowledge of
emptiness is key to this emancipatory process, as Tsongkhapa claims,
for one must realize the emptiness of the Consequence School, the lack
of true essence, to be free from the subtle sense of self and achieve
nirvāṇa (Cozort 1998, 316). For the Geluk tradition, there is no
higher view than just the emptiness in the Consequence School, and
this view is also maintained to be a prerequisite for the esoteric
practices of tantra. Tantra is an important part of the path to
liberation in the Geluk tradition. It is a path to liberation that is
held to involve distinct, esoteric methods, but without diverging from
the philosophical view of emptiness, which is indispensable. For this
reason, Geluk philosophy is located squarely within the exoteric
domain of discourse: the intersubjective spaces of dialogue and
debate.


Therefore, rather than overcoming mistaken concepts by circumventing
them in a mystical flash of insight or an ecstatic experience of union,
the Geluk tradition offers a more sober way to overcome misconceptions,
one based on clear, rational analysis. That is, this tradition holds
reasoned analysis to be necessary to understand the nature of phenomena
(or rather, their lack of nature). This is because an
ascertainment of the lack of true existence is held to be necessary to
counteract the directly opposed notion – the apprehension of true
existence—which is the misinterpretation of reality (as more than
simply conventionally existing) that binds one to suffering. To do
this, it is not sufficient to simply “let be,” stare into
space, or ignore the cause of misinterpretation in some tranquil
“nonconceptual” meditation; rather, one must have insight
induced by reason that counteracts the habit of holding onto true
existence.


Thus, in Geluk philosophy, we can say that meaning is limited to
intelligibility. That is, insight into reality is not held to be beyond
thought, or attributed to some third category beyond the world that is
neither existent nor nonexistent, but is simply insight into a world
that is neither (ultimately) existent nor (conventionally) nonexistent.
Even though Geluk scholars consent to the fact that emptiness can be
perceived nonconceptually—in the rarified case of a highly developed
meditation – they maintain that the emptiness that is known
nonconceptually is no different from the emptiness that is conceptually
known. It is the conceptual ascertainment of emptiness that is
the principal element of the Geluk school’s philosophy. Moreover,
their emphasis on the practice of insight is not based on an appeal to
a direct, unmediated access to what is beyond concepts, but to
reason. Reason is also given priority over scriptural authority,
which is subjected to the scrutiny of analysis and is adjudicated by
reason (Tsongkhapa in Hopkins 1999, 71).
5. Geluk Education


Following Tsongkhapa, the Geluk tradition came to establish large
monastic institutions that set the standard for scholastic education
in Tibet. The curriculum at Geluk monastic institutions involves five
primary topics: metaphysics (abhidharma), epistemology
(pramāṇa), negative dialectics
(madhyamaka), path structure
(Abhisamayālaṃkāra), and ethics
(vinaya). Buddhist metaphysics instills the contours of a
Buddhist view, including causality, impermanence, and an
event-metaphysics that ties these two together. The path structure
also plays a central role in traditional Buddhist philosophy: it
provides the philosophy with a telos, a narrative arch toward
liberation and complete enlightenment. Ethics, too, is integral to
this path and to Buddhist philosophy in general, but the most
distinctive and interesting features of Geluk philosophy are found in
its epistemology, and in particular, negative dialectics. 


Geluk monks who train in philosophy study epistemology early in
their careers, and debate is a primary means by which this tradition is
internalized and enacted. Buddhist epistemology, as codified in
Dharmakīrti’s Commentary on Valid Cognition
(Pramāṇavārttika), lays out a systematic
presentation of the means of knowledge and the rules for valid
inference.  Dharmakīrti’s epistemology can be said to
be antirealist or conceptualist, in that he denies that language
directly relates to the contents of perception, which are ineffable
particulars. Yet to account for the relationship between real
particulars and unreal universals, the Geluk tradition develops what
has been dubbed a “semi-realist” position, whereby it
asserts that there are universals that are real entities in contrast to
the anti-realism that denies that universals are entities (Dreyfus 1997,
173). 


Straddling the delicate line between a realist view that affirms the
reality of universals and an antirealist one that denies the reality of
concepts, a Geluk account of epistemology holds that universals are
real, but that they do not exists separately from their particular
instances. For instance, the universal “cow” and the
particular instances of cow are held to be not utterly distinct, as
antirealists would have it, nor are they held to be the same, as a
strict realist would claim, but are rather said to be
“essentially the same but conceptually distinct” (Dreyfus 1997,
174–78). This relationship – of neither complete identity nor
utter difference—is an important part of the way the Geluk account
for the relationship between the two truths, as we saw above in their
description of the negative dialectics of the Middle Way. In the
epistemological context, articulating this relationship is an attempt
to account for the efficacy of concepts without giving universals an
autonomous existence apart from their instances.   Yet since
the Geluk tradition claims that Dharmakīrti’s
epistemological project represents an inferior philosophical position,
arguably studied for didactic purposes, we need not dwell further on
this thorny, scholastic topic. It is the nominalism of what Geluk
authors consider their own tradition—the view of the Consequence
School of the Middle Way—that is the hallmark of their
philosophy.
Along with positing the entity of disintegration, among the unique
features of the Consequence School are that the foundational
consciousness and self-awareness are not only denied ultimate
existence, but are held to not exist even conventionally.
Conventional truths are always subject to rational analysis; when their
conventional status is analyzed, no such self-awareness or foundational
consciousness is analytically found, and when analyzed in terms of

not only ultimate foundations, but even conventional
foundational theories are repudiated in his Consequence School.
