Although the term “exploitation” appears not to have been
used to describe unfair advantage-taking prior to the 19th
century, there are nevertheless extensive discussions of the themes
and problems that characterize contemporary discussions of
exploitation in the history of philosophy. Those themes include the
notion of justice and injustice in economic exchange, the role of
labor in the creation of value, and the justification and abuse of
private property, especially in capital and land.
Concerns about exploitation often take the form of unfair economic
exchange. Attempts to specify the principles that render an exchange
fair or unfair can be traced back at least as far as Aristotle, who
argued that a just exchange will embody a kind of reciprocity such
that the values of the goods exchanged are proportional
(Nicomachean Ethics, Book V, Part V). But while the notion of
proportionality is intuitively appealing, it is somewhat unclear
precisely what Aristotle had in mind by it, or what the most
defensible explication of the idea would be. To borrow
Aristotle’s own example, if a shoemaker and a builder trade, how
many pairs of shoes is proportional to a single house?
In the writings of St. Thomas Aquinas, we find the beginnings of a
much more sophisticated and promising approach to questions such as
this. In his Summa Theologiae, Aquinas sought to answer the
question of “whether a man may lawfully sell a thing for more
than it is worth?” The “worth” of a thing, for
Aquinas, was its just price. And the just price, according to Aquinas,
appears to have been simply the prevailing market price (Summa
Theologiae, part 2, second part, question 77; see also de Roover
1958 and Friedman 1980). Rather than relying on some fixed notion of
proportionality, Aquinas’ just price will be responsive to
considerations of supply and demand. But not just any price
that two individuals mutually agree upon will be deemed just on
Aquinas’ standard. Thus, a seller who takes advantage of fraud,
or a temporary monopoly, to charge an excessive price for an item
would be acting unjustly, insofar as his price is in excess of the
price at which similar goods typically sell in the relevant market.
But Aquinas saw nothing inherently sinful in selling a good for more
than one paid for it, or with charging enough to earn a profit, or to
compensate for risks involved in the productive process. Seeking
profit for its own sake may involve a certain sort of
“debasement”, but profit can also be sought in order to
fulfill necessary or even virtuous ends.
Later Scholastics would devote considerable attention to developing
and refining the notion of the just price. Of special concern was the
price attached to the lending of money, or interest. Since the
founding of the Catholic church, it was widely regarded as sinful for
lenders to charge interest on their loans, and so-called
“usury” was prohibited by canon and often by secular law.
Much of the concern regarding usury seems to have been driven by the
idea that the charging of interest involves an inequitable
exchange—lenders give something to borrowers, but demand back
more than they have given. But Aquinas seems to have been particularly
concerned that borrowers would often be driven to take out loans out
of necessity, and thus that their consent to the exchange is not fully
voluntary (Summa Theologiae, part 2, second part, question
78).
The much later natural law theorist John Locke also took up questions
regarding just and unjust prices, not in either of his well-known
treatises on government but in a lesser known tract titled,
Venditio. Locke, even more explicitly than Aquinas, saw the
just price as being equivalent to “the market price at the place
where he sells” (Locke 1661: 340). The relativity of the just
price to the particular market in which the transaction takes place is
important. For Locke argued that if two ships sailed laden with corn,
one to Dunkirk where there is a near famine taking place, and the
other to Ostend where normal conditions obtain, it would not be unjust
for the merchant to sell at a significantly higher price in the former
location than in the latter (so long as the higher price is one that
the buyers can afford). If the merchant did not charge a
higher price, Locke argued, then two problems would result. First, it
is likely that the merchant’s goods would simply be bought by
speculators and resold on a secondary market, thereby simply
redirecting the profit into somebody else’s hands without doing
anything to improve the situation of buyers. And second, if merchants
cannot charge a high price in “good” markets to cover
their losses in “bad” ones, they will soon operate at a
net loss and this will, Locke claims, “quickly put an end to
merchandising” (Locke 1661: 342).
What would be unjust would be for the merchant to sell an
item to a particular individual for a price higher than the general
market rate as might happen, for instance, if that individual is in
particular distress. Thus, Locke holds, if anchors typically sell for
a certain price, say 100 pounds, then it would be unjust
(exploitative) to charge the captain of a distressed ship 5000 pounds
for an anchor, simply because one knows he will be compelled to pay
it. The just price is the going market rate, where that rate is
determined by the general features of supply and demand, and
not the particular needs or vulnerabilities of any particular buyer or
seller.
Interest in exploitation as a feature of economic exchange is thus
almost as old as philosophy itself. It was not until the
19th century, however, that exploitation as a feature of
employment relationships came to be a subject of
philosophical and political concern. In a sense, of course, the
employment relationship is simply another instance of economic
exchange, with the laborer selling his or her work in exchange for
money in the form of wages. But two ideas led many people to think
that there was something special about labor. The first was a belief
that labor is the ultimate source of all economic value. The second
was the belief that labor morally entitles the laborer to the full
value of that which he or she has produced.
More will be said about the first of these ideas in the discussion of
Marx’s theory of exploitation, below. The second idea, and its
connection to the idea of labor exploitation, is perhaps best
illustrated by the theory put forth by the 19th century
liberal Thomas Hodgskin. For Hodgskin, as for Locke from whose ideas
he drew heavily, the right of private property is a natural,
pre-political right. That right consists in 
the right of individuals, to have and to own, for their own separate
use and enjoyment, the produce of their own industry, with
power freely to dispose of the whole of that in the manner most
agreeable to themselves. (Hodgkin 1832: 24) 
But while the natural right of property is based on labor, there is
also an artificial right of property that is based on nothing
more than legislative force. That artificial right cements in place,
through the machinery of government, property claims that had their
origins not in labor but in violence, conquest, and theft. And it
thereby enables capitalists to profit without labor, simply by virtue
of their (illegitimate) control of the means of production (Reeve
1987b).
For Hodgskin, capitalists exploit workers in precisely the same way
that landlords exploit their tenants. In both cases, one person is
entitled to a stream of revenue simply by virtue of their legal claim
of ownership (Hodgskin 1832: 97). The money the landlord earns as rent
comes from the wages the tenant earns as a laborer, just as the money
the capitalist earns as profit comes from the sale of products
produced by his laborers. In both cases, one person is able to live as
a parasite off the productive activities of others, all because the
state actively suppresses the natural right of laborers to the full
product of their labor, in favor of the artificial right of property
established by violence.
Even before Marx, then, we see in the 19th century a tight
connection between theories of exploitation and theories of class and
of class conflict. Marx himself credited the “bourgeois
economists” of the French Industrialist school with
having pioneered the economic analysis of class struggle (Marx
& Engels 1965: 69). For members of that school, the two great
classes into which society was divided were productive
laborers and unproductive social parasites. The class of
productive laborers was understood broadly to encompass not only those
who exerted physical labor to create tangible goods and services, but
anyone who worked to make goods more useful than they would otherwise
be—so laborers, yes, but also entrepreneurs,
arbitrageurs, and even capitalists in their role as managers
and overseers of investments. The unproductive classes, in contrast,
consisted of those who consume value but do not produce it, such as
the army, the government, and the state-supported clergy (Raico 1977:
395).
According to Industrialists such as Charles Comte and Jean-Baptiste
Say, the unproductive classes are able to maintain themselves by using
the coercive power of government to forcibly extract resources from
the productive. Taxes and tariffs were the most obvious forms such
“plunder” could take, but the same goal could also be
achieved by special protections for favored industries including the
limited conferral of monopoly power (Say 1964: 146–147).
For both Hodgskin and for the Industrialists, then, the state was a
key agent in facilitating the exploitation of one class of individuals
by another, and the most certain way to end exploitation was therefore
to sharply limit the power of the state and to strengthen the
“natural” right of private property. But not all theorists
of the 19th century saw things this way. For Ricardian
Socialists such as John Bray, ending exploitation would require
ensuring that all persons have equal access to the means of
production, and thereby guaranteeing a system of equal exchange based
on the labor theory of value (Bray 1839). While Hodgskin and the
Industrialists sought to purify capitalism from statist interference,
Bray and his fellow socialists sought to eliminate it altogether.
By far the most influential theory of exploitation ever set forth is
that of Karl Marx, who held that workers in a capitalist society are
exploited insofar as they are forced to sell their labor power to
capitalists for less than the full value of the commodities they
produce with their labor.
For Marx, however, exploitation was a phenomenon that characterized
all class-based societies, not only capitalism. Indeed, it is
feudal society, not capitalism, where the exploitative nature of class
relations is clearest. Under feudalism, it is readily apparent that
serfs use some of their labor power for their own benefit, while
another part (the corvée) is used for the benefit of
the feudal lord. In contrast, under slavery workers appear to
work entirely for the benefit of their masters (though in reality a
part of their labor goes toward providing for their own subsistence).
And under capitalism workers appear to work entirely for the
benefit of themselves, selling their labor to capitalists as free
independent contractors (Cohen 1978: 332–3).
In reality, Marx thought, workers’ labor under capitalism is
neither truly voluntary nor entirely for the benefit of the workers
themselves. It is not truly voluntary because workers are
forced by their lack of ownership of the means of production
to sell their labor power to capitalists or else starve. And workers
are not laboring entirely for their own benefit because capitalists
use their privileged position to exploit workers,
appropriating for themselves some of the value created by
workers’ labor.
To understand Marx’s charge of exploitation, it is first
necessary to understand Marx’s analysis of market prices, which
he largely inherited from earlier classical economists such as Adam
Smith and David Ricardo. Under capitalism, Marx argued, workers’
labor power is treated as a commodity. And because Marx subscribed to
a labor theory of value, this means that just like any other commodity
such as butter or corn, the price (or wage) of labor power is
determined by its cost of production—specifically, by the
quantity of socially necessary labor required to produce it. The cost
of producing labor power is the value or labor-cost required for the
conservation and reproduction of a worker’s labor power. In
other words, Marx thought that workers under capitalism will therefore
be paid just enough to cover the bare necessities of living. They will
be paid subsistence wages.
But while labor power is just like any other commodity in terms of how
its price is determined, it is unique in one very importance respect.
Labor, and labor alone, according to Marx, has the capacity to
produce value beyond that which is necessary for its own
reproduction. In other words, the value that goes into the commodities
that sustain a worker for a twelve-hour work day is less than the
value of the commodities that worker can produce during those
twelve hours. This difference between the value a worker produces in a
given period of time and the value of the consumption goods necessary
to sustain the worker for that period is what Marx called surplus
value.
According to Marx, then, it is as though the worker’s day is
split into two parts. During the first part, the laborer works for
himself, producing commodities the value of which is equal to the
value of the wages he receives. During the second part, the laborer
works for the capitalist, producing surplus value for the capitalist
for which he receives no equivalent wages. During this second part of
the day, the laborer’s work is, in effect, unpaid, in precisely
the same way (though not as visibly) as a feudal serf’s
corvée is unpaid (Marx 1867).
Capitalist exploitation thus consists in the forced appropriation by
capitalists of the surplus value produced by workers. Workers under
capitalism are compelled by their lack of ownership of the means of
production to sell their labor power to capitalists for less than the
full value of the goods they produce. Capitalists, in turn, need not
produce anything themselves but are able to live instead off the
productive energies of workers. And the surplus value that capitalists
are thereby able to appropriate from workers becomes the source of
capitalist profit, thereby “strengthening that very power whose
slave it is” (Marx 1847: 40).
In the first volume of Capital, Marx presents a series of
formulas representing a tight relationship between labor,
exploitation, and capitalist profit. According to Marx, the value of a
commodity is a function of three factors: constant capital (\(C\), the
labor value of nonlabor means of production such as machines,
buildings, and raw materials), variable capital (\(V\), the labor
value of the labor power of workers involved in production), and
surplus value (\(S\)). Since surplus value comes from the exploitation
of labor (rather than machines or land), Marx defined the rate of
exploitation as the ratio of surplus value over variable capital
\((S/V)\). Of course, different industries will employ different mixes
of labor and other factors of production—of variable and
constant capital. Marx referred to this mixture as the organic
composition of capital, and defined it as \(C/V\). But since
capitalist profit is generated by the exploitation of labor, it seems
to follow that industries that employ a greater proportion of labor
(of variable over constant capital) should therefore earn a higher
rate of profit. Thus, Marx defined the rate of profit as
\((S/(C+V))\), which is equivalent to the rate of exploitation divided
by the organic composition of \(\textrm{capital} + 1\). This last
proposition has been referred to by Jon Elster as the
“fundamental equation of Marxian economics” (Elster 1986:
67).
Marx’s analysis of the rate of profit seems to entail that
labor-intensive industries will be more profitable than industries
that rely to a greater extent on constant capital. But this conclusion
is clearly empirically false (Böhm-Bawerk 1898), and moreover
incompatible with Marx’s assumption of a competitive economy in
which investments will adjust so as to equalize the rate of profit
between industries (Arnold 1990: Ch. 3; Buchanan 1985: Ch. 3). Marx
himself recognized this fact, and sought to address it in the third
volume of Capital by dropping the assumption of volume 1 that
value and price are equivalent, and showing instead
how value can be transformed into price through some more
complicated process. Whether Marx’s attempted solution to this
“transformation problem” was successful, however, is a
matter of great controversy (Arnold 1990: Ch. 3; Samuelson 1971;
Kliman 2007).
Marx’s theory of exploitation appears to presuppose that labor
is the source of all value. But the labor theory of value to which
Marx and early classical economists subscribed is subject to a number
of apparently insurmountable difficulties, and has largely been
abandoned by economists in the wake of the marginalist revolution of
the 1870s. The most obvious difficulty stems from the fact that labor
is heterogeneous. Some labor is skilled, some labor is unskilled, and
there does not appear to be any satisfactory way of reducing the
former to the latter and thereby establishing a single standard of
measure for the value of commodities. Moreover, the labor theory of
value appears to be unable to account for the economic value of
commodities such as land and raw materials that are not and could not
be produced by any human labor. Finally, and perhaps most fatally,
Marx’s assumption that labor has the unique power to create
surplus value is entirely ungrounded. As Robert Paul Wolff has argued,
Marx’s focus on labor appears to be entirely arbitrary. A
formally identical theory of value could be constructed with
any commodity taking the place of labor, and thus a
“corn theory of value” would be just as legitimate, and
just as unhelpful, as Marx’s labor theory of value (Wolff 1981).
Therefore, if, as some have alleged, Marx’s theory of
exploitation is dependent on the truth of the labor theory of value,
then a rejection of the labor theory of value should entail a
rejection of Marx’s theory of exploitation as well (Nozick 1974;
Arnold 1990).
Not everyone agrees, however, that Marx’s theory is
dependent on the labor theory of value in this way. G.A. Cohen, for
instance, argues that Marx’s theory of exploitation is not only
independent of the labor theory of value, but incompatible
with it (Cohen 1979: 345–6). Marx’s account of
exploitation is premised on the claim that value created by workers is
appropriated by capitalists. But the labor theory of value holds that
the value of an object is a function of the labor that would be
currently required to produce it, regardless of how much
labor actually went into producing it. Paradoxical as it may seem, the
labor theory of value is incompatible with the claim that labor alone
creates value.
The real problem with exploitation, on Cohen’s view, is not that
capitalists appropriate value that is created by labor. It
is, rather, that capitalists appropriate some of the value of the
products that are created by labor. Labor may not produce
value, but it is the only thing that produces what has value,
and this is all Marx needs to get his account of exploitation off the
ground (Cohen 1979: 354).
But even if Cohen’s account of exploitation avoids commitment to
the labor theory of value, it nevertheless remains committed to the
Marxian idea that exploitation should be understood as the forced
appropriation of surplus value. And there are at least two respects in
which this commitment is problematic. First, it is unclear whether
exploitation necessarily involves the forced transfer of
surplus value. Marx’s account asserts that the laborer is forced
to work for capitalists because the only alternative is starvation.
But suppose the government provides a safety net sufficient to ensure
that workers’ subsistence needs are met. If someone chooses to
work in order to earn discretionary income, it still seems possible
that they could be exploited by a capitalist who appropriates some of
the value of the product the laborer creates (Kymlicka 2002: 179). A
laborer can be exploited, we might think, by being paid an
unfair wage even if that laborer is not forced to
work.
Second, it is unclear whether all cases involving the forced transfer
of surplus value are necessarily exploitative, at least in the
ordinary sense of involving a moral wrong. Suppose that governments
tax workers and use some of the proceeds to provide support for
children or the infirm. If it is exploitative for capitalists to
appropriate some of the value of the objects produced by workers, is
it not also exploitative for government to do so through the mechanism
of taxation? Some libertarians have argued that this is precisely how
we should understand the coercive power of government. For Cohen,
however, the fact that Marx’s account of exploitation appears to
be committed to the libertarian idea of that workers own their labor
and the products they produce with that labor—that is, to the
libertarian idea of self-ownership—is deeply problematic (Cohen
1995: Ch. 6).
In its broadest sense, transactional/micro-level exploitation involves
an agent, A, taking unfair advantage of another agent,
B. Taking unfair advantage, in turn, can be understood in two
ways. First, it can refer to some dimension of the outcome of the
exploitative act or transaction. In this case, we say that the
transaction is substantively unfair. Second, to say that
A takes unfair advantage of B may imply that there is
some sort of defect in the process by which the unfair outcome has
come about, for example, that A has coerced B or
defrauded B or has manipulated B. In this case, we say
that the transaction is procedurally unfair.
This section examines several elements or possible elements of
transactional exploitation: the benefit that exploitative transactions
confer upon A, the harm they cause to B, various notions
of substantive and procedural unfairness, and the unjust background
conditions against which exploitative transactions may take place.
When A exploits B, A gains some benefit
from interacting with B. We can see the relevance of the
“benefit to A” by contrasting exploitation with
other forms of wrongdoing, such as discrimination, abuse, and
oppression. Let us say that A discriminates against B
when A wrongly deprives B of some opportunity or benefit
because of some characteristic of B that is not relevant to
A’s action. There was a period in American history in
which many women became public school teachers because they were
denied the opportunity to enter other professions such as law and
medicine. To the extent that society benefitted (in one way) from the
pool of highly qualified public school teachers, the discrimination
may have been exploitative, even if unintentionally so. But if
A refuses to hire B solely because of B’s
race, then it would be odd to say that A exploits B, for
A does not gain from the wrong to B.
Consider abuse. It has been alleged that medical students are
frequently abused by verbal insults and denigration and that this
abuse may leave long-lasting emotional scars. It is also sometimes
claimed that medical interns are exploited, that they work long hours
for low pay. The contrast is just right. There is no reason to think
that anyone gains (in any normal sense) from abuse, but it is at least
plausible to think that the hospitals or patients gain from the
exploitation of interns.
Let us say that A oppresses B when A deprives
B of freedoms or opportunities to which B is entitled.
If A gains from the oppressive relationship, as when A
enslaves B, then A may both oppress and exploit
B. But if A does not gain from the oppression, the
oppression is wrong but not exploitative. We might say that the
unemployed are oppressed, but unless we could specify the ways in
which some gain from their lack of employment, the unemployed are not
exploited. Marxists would claim that capitalists pay exploitative
wages to the employed precisely because there is a “reserve
army” of the unemployed with whom the employed must compete. But
that merely confirms that they are exploited because the oppression
generates a gain to the capitalist class, and it is the employed who
are exploited and not the unemployed that make such exploitation
possible.
Clearly, an exchange still counts as exploitative even if A
does not benefit on net. If A derives unfair benefit
from his interaction with B, but suffers unforeseen costs such
that she ends up worse-off after the interaction than she was before,
then A has still exploited B. Less clear is the question
of whether A must derive any actual benefit at all, or whether
it is enough that A merely intend to benefit. Suppose
a sweatshop owner works his employees ruthlessly in order to extract
as much profit as he can from the workers’ labor, but that the
product the laborers produce turns out, due to an unforeseen turn of
events, to have zero market value. Have the sweatshop workers
nevertheless been exploited? 
Related to the question of whether A’s intent to benefit
is sufficient for exploitation is the question of whether
A’s intent to benefit unfairly is
necessary for exploitation. Is it possible to exploit someone
by mistake? Can one foresee that one’s interaction will be
exploitative without intending it to be so? If so, is A still
culpable? (Ferguson 2016b)
Exploitation thus involves A unfairly benefitting from an
interaction with B. But what exactly does it mean to benefit
unfairly? One natural response to this question is to
conceive of unfairness as benefitting A at B’s
expense. Perhaps exploitation advances the interests of
A while harming B. Exploitation, thus
understood, is a kind of parasitism. Or, as Allen Buchanan defines it,
exploitation is “the harmful, merely instrumental utilization of
him or his capacities, for one’s own advantage or for the sake
of one’s own ends” (Buchanan 1985: 87).
Certain paradigmatic cases of exploitation clearly fit this analysis.
Slavery is an exploitative relationship, and one that clearly harms
slaves for the benefit of their masters. But as Alan Wertheimer has
noted, some exploitation appears to be mutually advantageous
rather than harmful (Wertheimer 1996: 14). Someone who charges a hiker
lost in the desert $1,000 for a bottle of water takes unfair advantage
of her. Nevertheless, the transaction is one from which both
parties emerge better off relative to how they would have been, had
the transaction not taken place. The seller has traded away something
she values less (the bottle of water) for something she values more
($1,000). But so has the buyer. If the water is necessary to save her
life, and if she values her life more than the $1,000 she gives up to
save it, then she too is better off with the transaction than without
it.
In this way, exploitation is importantly different from coercion, even
though both coercion and exploitation can involve individuals
accepting proposals that appear to make them better off relative to
some baseline. In a paradigmatic case of coercion—a mugger who
demands “your money or your life”—the victim is
better off handing over the money than losing her life. But she would
be better off still if the mugger had never showed up to make her
proposal at all. In contrast, the stranded hiker would be considerably
worse off if her exploiter never showed up. Coercion
characteristically involves threats by which the coercer
proposes to make her victim worse off unless she does as the
coercer demands. Exploitation, in contrast, often involves
offers by which the exploiter proposes to make her victim
better off if she does as the exploiter proposes.
There is, however, one important sense in which even an exploiter
could be said to harm her victim. Relative to a baseline of no
transaction at all, exploitation often makes its victim better off.
But relative to a baseline of a fair transaction,
exploitation leaves its victim worse off. In this sense, an
exploiter’s gain does, contra Joel Feinberg, come at the
victim’s expense (Feinberg 1988: 178). For even when both
parties gain from the transaction, the victim of exploitation gains
less than she should because some of the “cooperative
surplus” to which she is by fairness entitled has been captured
by the exploiter.
Exploitation therefore does not necessarily harm its victim in the
sense of making her worse off than she would have been, had the
exploiter never interacted with her at all. Rather, it makes its
victim worse off than she should have been, had she been
treated fairly. As with similar cases involving coercion, the precise
details of our analysis thus depend on the relevant baseline against
which we choose to compare B’s situation after the
interaction. But these details probably do not matter much as far as
our all-things-considered moral evaluation is concerned. Whether we
choose to say that exploitation involves A making B
better off, but not as much better off as A should have made
B; or whether we say that it involves making B worse off
than B should have been, the final verdict is the same
(Wertheimer 1996: 22–23).
In the sense in which we are using the term, exploitation necessarily
(conceptually) involves unfairness. Our sense of exploitation is thus
a moralized term. To judge that someone is engaged in
exploitation is already to pass a moral judgment on them—to say
that they are acting wrongly (at least in a pro tanto sense).
Not all uses of “exploitation” are moralized in this way.
As we noted at the beginning of this entry, some ordinary language use
of the term implies no moral judgment whatsoever. And it is possible
to develop a philosophically sophisticated account of exploitation
that is relevant to moral judgment, without being moralized
(Goodin 1987).
Still, even if exploitation is not conceptually unfair, it is
characteristically so. In some cases, this unfairness is the result of
some procedural defect in the transaction—call this
procedural unfairness. In other cases, the unfairness is a
feature of what is agreed to, rather than how the agreement
is reached—call this substantive unfairness.
A transaction will be exploitative due to procedural unfairness when
A unfairly utilizes or creates a defect in the process of the
transaction with B in way that benefits A at
B’s expense (though see the previous section for an
analysis of “at B’s expense”). So, for
instance, if A deceives B regarding the nature of the
good A is selling, in a way that leads B to pay more for
that good than B otherwise would have, we can say that A
has taken unfair advantage of B—that A has
exploited B. Or if A unfairly pressures B to
agree to A’s proposed terms—threatening to
physically hurt B or someone B loves, for
instance—we can again say that A has exploited
B.
But while we can (correctly) say that A has exploited
B in these situations, we could also say, more directly and
more clearly, that A has defrauded or coerced
B. That is, we already have a rich set of more
narrowly-tailored terms for identifying the ways in which A
might undermine the validity of B’s consent to the terms
of their agreement. For this reason, it seems superfluous—and
indeed, it is rare—to describe these sorts of procedural defects
as “exploitative”. At least when A creates
the defect from which he benefits, we usually have a better term
available to describe the specific form of his wrongdoing.
The label “exploitation” seems more appropriate when
A unfairly takes advantage of an existing defect
(Jansen and Wall 2013). A teenage boy who trades five pennies for his
5 year-old brother’s single quarter exploits his brother insofar
as he takes unfair advantage of his ignorance of monetary units. But
he does not coerce him, nor does he necessarily deceive him.
Similarly, a psychotherapist who takes advantage of his
patient’s therapy-induced romantic feelings to engage in sexual
relations can be said to exploit his patient, even if there is no
outright fraud or deception in the interaction (and even if the
substantive “terms” of their relationship are in no way
unfair). In these cases, exploitation seems to be the most apt
description for the wrongdoing.
There is widespread agreement among philosophers and legal theorists
on the broad categories of behavior that render a transaction
procedurally unfair, even if there is (as always) persistent
disagreement about borderline cases of coercion, fraud, etc. In
contrast, there is much less agreement regarding those conditions that
render a transaction substantively unfair.
One of the most intuitively appealing criteria of fairness in exchange
is equality. A fair exchange, it is tempting to say, is an
equal exchange. But equal in terms of what?
Although Marx took pains to deny he was giving an account of justice
(let alone fairness), much of the intuitive force of his account of
labor exploitation seems to rely on the idea that a fair exchange will
embody equal transfers of socially necessary labor. It is
because the objects produced by the worker embody more socially
necessary labor than the wages he receives in exchange for producing
those objects that the laborer is exploited. And other
late-19th century theorists such as Josiah Warren and
Stephen Pearl Andrews made this moral claim explicit. “It is
clear”, wrote Andrews, 
if [an] exchange is not equal, if one party gives more of his own
labor—either in the form of labor or product—than he
gets of the labor of the other…that he is oppressed,
and becomes, so far as this inequality goes, the slave or subject of
the other. (Andrews 1852: 52–53) 
But even though a theory of labor-time as the basis of fair exchange
is in principle distinguishable from a labor theory of economic value,
the former is subject to many of the same problems as the latter. How,
for instance, should the difference between skilled and unskilled
labor time be accounted for in determining a fair exchange? Between
easy and difficult labor? Labor is not homogenous, and this makes it
ill-suited to serve as a currency of fair exchange.
If labor is the wrong place to look for a criterion of fair exchange,
perhaps economic value would be better. A fair trade, on this
view, involves the exchange of equally valuable goods or services. And
an unfair trade involves the exchange of goods or services of unequal
value. To return to an earlier example, someone who sells a bottle of
water to a hiker stranded in the desert for $1,000 takes unfair
advantage of her. And part of what makes the exchange unfair is that
the bottle of water simply isn’t worth nearly $1,000. B
is giving up far more than she gains in exchange.
Or is she? Once we give up on the 19th century notion that
economic value is an objective property of commodities, and embrace
instead that value is a function of the subjective preferences of
economic agents, the problem with this analysis becomes readily
apparent. Economic exchange is only possible precisely because
different agents assign different values to the same object. I sell
you my old television for $75 because I’ve bought a new set, and
to me, the old television is worth less than the $75. You pay the $75
because you just moved into a new place and, to you, the $75 is worth
less than the television. Neither of our valuations is the
“right” one. Our preferences simply differ, and so it is
possible for us to both walk away from the deal
believing—correctly!—that we have gotten more than we have
given up.
Cooperative exchanges create what economists call a “social
surplus”. Suppose, to continue the television example, that
I’d be willing to take anything equal to or greater than $50 in
exchange for my television, and that you’d be willing to pay
anything equal to or less than $100 for it. If, after bargaining, we
arrive at a sale price of $75, then I give up something I value at
$50 in exchange for $75, and come away $25 richer, and you give up $75 in exchange for something you value at $100 and
walk away $25 richer. All together, we’re $50 richer.
That’s the social surplus.
This suggests one final possible egalitarian analysis of fair
exchange. Perhaps what makes an exchange is fair is not that the
objects traded have equal economic value, but rather the equal
division of the social surplus created by the exchange of objects of
unequal subjective value. Exploitative exchanges, in contrast, are
those in which one party commands a disproportionately large share of
the social surplus, leaving the other party with an unfairly small
share. For example, suppose that an employer gains $10 per hour worth
of value from an employee’s labor. An employer like that could
afford to pay its workers $9 per hour and still make a profit. But if
potential employees have nowhere else to go, why should the employer
pay that much? Why not pay employees as little as she can get away
with—maybe $3 an hour, just barely over the subsistence level of
$2? In this case the employment relationship would generate a social
surplus of $8. But $7 of that surplus would go into the pocket of the
employer, while only $1 goes to the laborer. Might not that lopsided
division of the social surplus be precisely what’s unfair, and
thus exploitative, about this kind of labor?
Perhaps. But the unequal division of the social surplus cannot explain
all cases of exploitation—including some of the most
paradigmatic. To see this, let us return once more to the case of the
lost desert hiker. A offers to sell B a bottle of water
for $1,000. This would appear to be a clear instance of an
exploitative proposal. But it is not, as suggested above, because the
water bottle is worth less than $1,000 to B. Indeed,
it is probably worth far more! Most people put a fairly high value on
their continued existence. So, suppose B values not dying at $1
million. In that case, B gives up something he values at $1,000
in exchange for something he values at $1 million. A, in turn,
gives up something he values at close to $0 in exchange for something
he values at $1,000. The exchange creates a social surplus of $1
million, but fully 99.9% of that surplus goes to B,
leaving A with a mere .1%. If exploitation consists of grabbing
the lion’s share of the social surplus of an exchange, then we
are forced to conclude that thirsty B is actually exploiting
water-selling A—an unlikely result!
It is thus difficult to specify an egalitarian criterion of fairness
that explains the wrongfulness of exploitation across a range of
cases. For this reason, most current theories of exploitation are not
fundamentally egalitarian in nature. Some, like those put forward by
Allen Wood, Ruth Sample, and Jeremy Snyder, are based in the Kantian
idea of respect for persons. Sample, for instance, defines
exploitation as “interacting with another being for the sake of
advantage in a way that fails to respect the inherent value in that
being” (Sample 2003: 57). According to Sample, one can fail to
respect the inherent value of others in several distinct ways. One way
involves failing to respond appropriately to the unmet basic needs of
others. Respect for others imposes upon us an imperfect duty of
beneficence, a duty that Jeremy Snyder argues is
“specified” when we come face to face with particular
others and thereby takes on a perfect, strict form (Snyder 2008: 390).
When we encounter others whose basic needs are unmet, we should help
them because of the inherent value they possess as a human being. But
the exploiter sees in the unmet basic needs of others not a cry for
help but as an opportunity for profit.
Sample’s and Snyder’s respect-based accounts are
simultaneously more narrow and more broad than fairness-based accounts
of exploitation. They are broader insofar as they will condemn as
exploitative transactions that might pass as non-exploitative on a
fairness approach. Selling a bottle of water at a normal market price
to the hiker lost in the desert, for instance, might be fair but still
insufficiently responsive to the hiker’s unmet basic need for
drink. But the accounts are also considerably narrower than
fairness-based accounts insofar as the range of goods or transactions
to which they apply is more circumscribed. On both Sample’s and
Snyder’s accounts, for instance, it is not wrongfully
exploitative for a seller to use his knowledge of a buyer’s
unusually strong desire for a painting to charge that buyer an
extremely high price. Because the buyer’s basic needs are not
implicated, charging a high price in this sort of cases does not
signal disrespect for persons, even if the price is one that would
otherwise appear to be unfairly high.
Sample’s account, like Goodin’s, holds that taking
advantage of certain kinds of vulnerability is wrongfully exploitative
regardless of how those vulnerabilities came about. But as Benjamin
Ferguson has noted, this has the potential to create a certain kind of
moral hazard problem (Ferguson 2016b). Suppose that A knows
that, should he become vulnerable for whatever reason, B will
be obligated to constrain B’s advantage over
A—perhaps by selling B goods for less than the
normal market price. Given this knowledge, A might be tempted
to take a risky gamble, knowing that if it doesn’t turn out
well, B will be obligated to partly subsidize A’s
loss. In effect, B’s obligation toward A puts
B in a position of vulnerability, a vulnerability that A
has the potential to unfairly take advantage of. In other words,
A’s obligation not to exploit B renders A
vulnerable to exploitation by B! In order to avoid
this difficulty, it seems necessary to limit the kinds of
vulnerabilities that trigger the obligation to constrain one’s
advantage, perhaps by ruling out vulnerabilities for which the agent
is morally responsible.
Many have found plausible Marx’s claim that employment
relationships under capitalism are exploitative. But perhaps Marx was
wrong to locate that exploitation in the particular details of the
capitalist-employee relationship. After all, what makes exploitation
possible at all on Marx’s view is a feature of the macro level
distribution of property in society—specifically
capitalists’ monopoly over the means of production. Marx’s
formal theory of exploitation, however, makes no explicit mention of
this property relation, focusing instead entirely on the interaction
between capitalists and laborers at the point of production. The
result, according to John Roemer, is a theory that is focused too much
on the micro level of particular employment relationships and not
enough on the macro level background of inegalitarian property
distribution against which those relationships take place (Roemer
1982).
On Roemer’s analysis, capitalist exploitation is essentially a
form of social parasitism. One group (the capitalists) are made better
off by the existence of a second group (workers), but that second
group is made worse off by the existence of the first. More
formally, according to Roemer’s account, we may say that a group
\(S\) is exploited by \(S'\) if and only if all of the following three
conditions are satisfied:
Suppose workers form the coalition \(S\), and capitalists form the
coalition \(S'\). Workers are exploited, on Roemer’s view,
because property rights in the means of production are monopolized by
capitalists. If workers were to withdraw from society with a per
capita share of society’s alienable assets, including the
means of production, they would be better off than they are right now
 (condition 1
 is satisfied). If capitalists were to withdraw with only
their per capita share of society’s alienable assets, they would
be worse off since some of their currently held share would go to
workers
 (condition 2
 is satisfied). Finally, if workers to withdraw from society with only
the assets to which they are entitled under their existing legal
regime—their bodies and their labor—then capitalists would
be worse off, since they would no longer be able to profit by
exploiting workers labor
 (condition 3
 is satisfied). What this shows is that the existing distribution of
property makes capitalists better off at workers’ expense. It is
a parasitic, exploitative arrangement.
Roemer’s account coheres well with the intuitive sense of
exploitation as unfair treatment over a wide range of cases. In cases
where we think that an inegalitarian distribution of property has been
unjustly produced, then a system that puts that distribution
to use to benefit one class at the expense of another will seem
wrongfully exploitative. This, presumably, is the point of
Marx’s account of the “primitive accumulation” of
capital, which aims to show that capitalists’ monopoly over the
means of production is the product of violence and theft rather than
hard work and thrift (Marx 1867: Ch. 26).
But even if actually existing capitalism’s history is tainted in
this way, it is possible to imagine an inegalitarian distribution of
property emerging, in Robert Nozick’s language, “from a
just situation by just steps” (Nozick 1974: 151). Suppose a
society begins with an egalitarian distribution and evolves, through a
mix of voluntary choices and luck—but no procedural injustices
such as force or fraud—into a society with significant
inequalities. Such a society might contain a relatively poor coalition
\(S\) that would do better if it appropriated some of the alienable
property belonging to relatively wealthy \(S'\) and withdrew with a
per capita share of society’s alienable assets
 (condition 1).
 And \(S'\) would, in turn, be worse off if it was able to withdraw
with only a per capita share of those assets
 (condition 2).
 Finally, if \(S\) and \(S'\) are engaged in mutually beneficial
exchange in the present society, then \(S'\) might well be worse off
if \(S\) were to withdraw from society, even if \(S\) took only its
own assets
 (condition 3).
 A society such as this satisfies all of Roemer’s conditions for
exploitation. But it is far from clear that there is anything wrongful
or unjust in it.
Roemer’s account also runs into the same difficulty as those
Marxist accounts that view the forced transfer of surplus value as
necessarily exploitative. It seems forced to condemn a society in
which the able-bodied and well-off are taxed to support children and
the infirm as exploitative, since the able-bodied would be better off
if they withdrew with their own resources, while children and the
inform would be worse off (Elster 1982). Roemer attempts to grapple
with this problem by stipulating that exploitation involves something
more than the satisfaction of
 conditions 1 through 3,
 and suggests that the missing condition might be a relationship of
“dominance” of the exploiter over the exploited. But as
Will Kymlicka has noted, this stipulation seems 
ad hoc, since [it is] disconnected from the ‘ethical
imperative’ that [Roemer] identifies as the basis of
exploitation theory (Kymlicka 2002: 204 n. 13). And Roemer himself
admits that lack of clarity regarding the concept of dominance
prevents his account from being a “satisfactory analytical
account of exploitation. (Roemer 1982: 304 n. 12).
Even if Roemer’s account were entirely satisfactory on its own
terms, however, it would still seem to leave a large, important class
of questions about exploitation unanswered. Precisely because
Roemer’s account is focused on “macro” issues
pertaining to the distribution of property in society, it has little
to say about “micro” issues regarding how individuals
treat each other within the framework created by that distribution
(Ferguson and Steiner 2016: 13–14). Intuitively, it seems
possible for individuals to treat each other exploitatively even
within a just distribution of property; and it likewise seems possible
for individuals to treat each other fairly within an unjust
distribution of property. That Roemer’s account does not address
these issues of micro-level treatment is not necessarily a flaw in the
theory. But it does suggest, at the very least, that a different or
more comprehensive theory of exploitation is necessary to supplement
Roemer’s exclusively macro-level approach.
Giijs van Donselaar’s account of exploitation is based on the
idea that exploitation is a form of harmful parasitism. An
exploitative relationship, for Donselaar, is one that involves
“worsening the position of others in bettering one’s
own” (van Donselaar 2009: 7). In such a relationship, A uses and benefits
from B, but B would be better off if A had never
existed or never interacted with him at all. So, for example, if
A homesteads a plot of land by mixing his labor with it only
because he knows B wants the land and will be willing to pay
him a large sum of money for it, then A exploits B in
the Donselaarian sense. Or, similarly, if A proposes to build a
second story to his home only because his neighbor B will be
willing to pay him not to do it in order to preserve his view, then
A exploits B. In cases like these, A acts within
his rights, but he “abuses” his rights to extract benefits
from B.
Intuitively, there seems to be something unfair about the kinds of
activities van Donselaar has identified as exploitative. But there are
also activities that satisfy his criteria for exploitation that do not
seem intuitively unfair. Many cases of ordinary market competition,
for instance, involve situations of this sort. Suppose that A
and B compete for a job and that A, being the more
highly qualified candidate, is offered the position. A accepts,
and then offers B a job as her secretary. In this situation,
A gains by interacting with B, but B would be
better off if A never existed at all. Likewise, if B is
a disabled citizen who is offered a taxpayer-financed stipend by the
government, then B benefits from the existence of taxpayer
A, while A is worse off than she would be if B
had never existed. As Richard Arneson notes, “one man’s
parasitism is another man’s distributive justice” (Arneson
2013: 9).
The second challenge faced by van Donselaar is nearly identical to a
difficulty we discussed above with John Roemer’s
property-relations account of exploitation. And as we have seen,
Roemer himself suggested one way of avoiding the
difficulty—namely, adding a dominance condition to his
account of exploitation. Intuitively, capitalists at least have the
capacity to dominate their employees, but disabled people
living on a pension do not dominate taxpayers, nor do they have the
capacity to do so.
Nicholas Vrousalis elaborates on what he sees as a tight connection
between the concepts of exploitation and domination (Vrousalis 2013).
According to Vrousalis, A exploits B if and only if
A and B are embedded in a systematic relationship in
which A instrumentalizes B’s vulnerability to
extract a net benefit from B. And A dominates B
if A and B are embedded in a systematic relationship in
which A takes advantage of his power over B, or the
power of a coalition of agents A belongs to, in a way that is
disrespectful to B. Exploitation, then, is a particular form of
domination—domination for self-enrichment. Capitalists exploit
workers insofar as they treat workers as objects, using their power
and workers’ vulnerability to extract value from workers, all
embedded in the systematic relationships of a capitalist economy.
Vrousalis’s focus on systems is intended to
rehabilitate the most defensible elements of a broadly Marxian theory
of exploitation, and to establish exploitation as a concept distinct
from mere unfairness (Vrousalis 2014). But divorcing exploitation from
unfairness has its cost, for there are examples that fit
Vrousalis’s schema for exploitation that do not seem unfair, and
because they do not seem unfair, do not seem wrongful. If A is
a monopoly provider of heating oil, and B lives in a cold
climate, A has power over B and B is vulnerable.
But, intuitively, A does not have to take advantage of
that vulnerability. A could sell to B at a fair
price—i.e., a price lower than the maximum price that B
would, if necessary, be willing to pay. If she does so, A will
still extract a net benefit from B, thereby satisfying
Vrousalis’s definition of exploitation. But it is far from
obvious that A will have acted in any way wrongly (Arneson
2013: 4).
In addition to failing to respond appropriately to others’ basic
needs, Sample also argues that exploitation can take the form of
taking advantage of past injustice (Sample 2003: 74). If A uses
the fact that B is disadvantaged as a result of past injustice
for his own profit then, Sample argues, A has failed to treat
B with respect and has exploited him for his own gain.
In setting forth this claim, Sample builds a certain
historical element into her account of exploitation. What
matters, on her view, is not merely whether a person in a position of
vulnerability is taken advantage of, but how it came about
that such advantage-taking was possible.
Other exploitation theorists have made similar claims. Hillel
Steiner’s account of exploitation, for example, holds that
exploitation occurs when A gains more from an interaction, and
B gains less, than they would have were it not for the
existence of a prior injustice (Steiner 1984). So, for example, if
A hires B as a laborer and is able to pay B a low
wage of $2 per hour only because A (or someone else) has
previously unjustly deprived B of alternative sources of labor,
then A has exploited B. If, on the other hand, the
explanation for B’s earning only $2 does not
involve injustice—if B simply does not have very valuable
skills, or if there is a large supply of (not unjustly) unemployed
laborers, then a $2 wage, no matter how insufficient it might be to
meet B’s needs, and no matter how much more A
could afford to pay, is not exploitative.
On the other hand, some theorists have argued that the source of
vulnerability is irrelevant to the exploitative nature of a
transaction. Robert Goodin, for instance, argues that exploitation
consists in “playing for advantage in situations where it is
inappropriate to do so”, and involves a violation of the moral
norm of “protecting the vulnerable”. Importantly, Goodin
holds that this norm applies “regardless of the particular
source of their vulnerability” (Goodin 1987: 187). Thus, whether
a worker is economically vulnerable because of a past injustice or
whether her vulnerability derives from a normal fluctuation of the
business cycle is irrelevant. To use that vulnerability to press
one’s own advantage is exploitative.
Similarly, Matt Zwolinski argues that whether an exchange is
exploitative or not depends on the terms of the transaction itself,
not on how the parties came to be in their respective ex ante
positions. Cases like the desert hiker, Zwolinski argues, show that
exploitation can occur in the absence of past injustice and thus that
taking advantage of past injustice is not a necessary component of
exploitation. And neither is it a sufficient condition, for we can
imagine cases where parties gain from past injustice without thereby
engaging in exploitation. If B’s home is unjustly burned
to the ground by an arsonist, and a contractor A charges
B a normal market price to rebuild it, then A has not
exploited B, despite the fact that A has profited from
the injustice suffered by B (Zwolinski 2012: 172).
The primary task of a theory of exploitation is to set forward the
truth conditions for the claim, “A exploits
B”. Beyond this purely conceptual project, however, there
remain two more straightforwardly normative tasks. Adopting
terminology from Alan Wertheimer, we can describe the first of these
tasks as providing an account of the moral weight of
exploitation, where moral weight refers to the intensity of
exploitation’s wrongness. The second task is to provide an
account of the moral force of exploitation, where moral force
is understood to refer to “the various moral upshots of reasons
for action that exploitation might or might not involve for parties to
the transaction or for society” (Wertheimer 1996: 28). 
When exploitation is harmful and nonconsensual, issues of both moral
weight and force are relatively unproblematic. Whatever the added
moral importance of the gain to A from the harm to B, it
is certainly at least prima facie wrong for A to harm
B and it seems that the state is at least prima facie
justified in prohibiting or refusing to enforce such transactions. But
exploitation that takes place in the context of mutually advantageous
and consensual transactions presents a more difficult set of problems.
First, regarding the issue of moral weight, it might be thought that
even if a transaction between A and B is unfair, there
can be nothing seriously wrong about an agreement from which
both parties benefit, particularly if A has no obligation to
enter into any transaction with B. At the very least, it seems
difficult to show how a mutually advantageous (but unfair) interaction
can be morally worse than no-interaction at all since, ex
hypothesi, there is no party to the transaction for whom it is
worse. In the recent literature on exploitation, this thought has been
formulated more precisely as the “non-worseness
claim”:
NWC: Interaction between A and B cannot be worse than
non-interaction when A has a right not to interact with
B at all, and when the interaction is mutually advantageous,
consensual, and free from negative externalities (Wertheimer 1996,
2011; Zwolinski 2009; Powell and Zwolinski 2012).
Most exploitation theorists are skeptical that the NWC is correct
(Wertheimer 1996; Bailey 2010; Arneson 2013; Barnes 2013; Malmqvist
2016). For if it were, then it would seem to be a mistake to blame
individuals who engage in certain forms of mutually beneficial
exploitation—for example, those who engage in “price
gouging” by selling electrical generators to victims of natural
disasters at inflated prices. (Zwolinski 2008). After all, we usually
would not blame those individuals if they stayed home and did nothing.
But, so long as people are willing to pay the high prices (and no
coercion or fraud is involved), both parties are better off with the
transaction than without it. So how could it be morally worse to
provide those customers with some benefit than it is to
provide them with no benefit at all?
Of course, the NWC need not lead to a deflationary account of the
wrongness of exploitation. It could, instead, lead to an
inflationary account of the wrongness of non-interaction. In
other words, we can account for the NWC’s claim that mutually
beneficial exploitation is not worse than non-interaction
either by saying that mutually beneficial exploitation is
less wrong than we thought it was, or by saying that
non-interaction is worse than we thought it was: by saying that price
gougers are less blameworthy than we thought, or by saying that those
who stay home and do nothing to help victims of disaster are
more blameworthy than we thought.
Even if mutually beneficial exploitation really is a serious moral
wrong, however, it might not be a kind of wrong that can justify state
intervention (Wertheimer 1996: Ch. 9). In other words, the question of
the moral force of exploitation cannot be settled entirely by
reference to its moral weight. Suppose A is a price gouger who
sells bottles of water to disaster victims for $12 each. Even if
A acts wrongly or fails to act virtuously, it is arguable that
A does not harm anyone or violate anyone’s rights, and
only harm or rights violations justify state intervention. If the
state cannot force A to sell the water to B, it might be
thought completely irrational for the state to prohibit
A and B from entering into a consensual and mutually
advantageous transaction.
Moreover, there is a real danger that preventing mutually beneficial
but exploitative transactions will wind up “consigning the
vulnerable person to an even worse fate than being exploited”
(Wood 1995: 156). After all, persons who are exploited are taken
advantage of because of some antecedent vulnerability—a lack of
access to clean drinking water, in the example above. Preventing
exploitative transactions by itself does nothing to alleviate
this vulnerability. Indeed, by depriving vulnerable parties of one
possibility for improving their situation by engaging in a
mutually beneficial transaction, such interference might actually
exacerbate it.
Perhaps this view is correct. Bracketing arguments based on
externalities, it seems perfectly plausible to maintain that the state
is justified in interfering with transactions only if one party is
violating the other’s rights. That said, those who invoke the
concept of exploitation frequently maintain that such exploitation
provides a reason for state intervention. For example, when it is
claimed that commercial surrogacy exploits the birth mothers, the
critics typically argue that surrogacy contracts should be
unenforceable or entirely prohibited. Similar things are said about
the sale of bodily organs. Those who make such arguments do frequently
claim that the transactions are nonconsensual or harmful, but they
seem prepared to make such arguments even if the transactions are
consensual and mutually advantageous.
On what grounds might we justify interfering with consensual and
mutually advantageous exploitative transactions? It might be thought
that we could interfere on paternalistic grounds. A paternalistic
argument could not justify interfering with exploitative transactions
if the exploitative transaction is advantageous to B and if
interference is not likely to result in a transaction that is more
beneficial to B. For paternalism justifies interfering for
someone’s good, and this interference would not be to the
target’s benefit. But there might be situations in which
B knows enough to agree only to those exploitative transactions
that are beneficial (as compared with no transaction), but does not
know that less exploitative transactions are available. And so there
may be a “soft paternalist” justification for interference
with some mutually advantageous exploitative transactions.
We might also justify interfering with exploitative transactions on
strategic grounds. Suppose that A enjoys a monopoly position,
say, as a potential rescuer of B. If we prohibit A from
charging an exorbitant price for his services, then A might
offer his services for a reasonable price. This argument would not
justify interfering in a highly competitive market, for, under such
conditions, A would not and could not offer his services for a
better price. But there may be numerous situations in which such
strategic arguments can work (Wertheimer 1996).
It is worth noting, however, that prohibiting exploitative
transactions is not the only way in which the state or other moral
agents might attempt to respond to its wrongful nature. Prohibition is
an example of what Allen Wood describes as “interference”.
But in addition to interference, Wood suggests that we can think of
redistribution as a way in which third parties such as the
state might attempt to prevent exploitation (Wood 1995: 154). After
all, exploitation is only possible because B is in a position
of vulnerability relative to A. One way to prevent
exploitation, then, is to address this vulnerability directly—to
channel resources to B so as to remove the hardship that makes
him vulnerable to exploitation in the first place. If workers in the
developing world had an adequate social safety net to fall back on,
for instance, they would be less inclined to accept a job with the
harsh conditions of a sweatshop, and therefore less vulnerable to
exploitation by their employers.
Questions about exploitation arise in a wide variety of different
contexts, not just in the domain of political philosophy but in
various areas of applied ethics as well such as business ethics,
biomedical ethics, and environmental ethics. In addition to the topics
discussed briefly below, the concept of exploitation has played a
central role in debates over payday lending (Mayer 2003), clinical
research in the developing world (Hawkins and Emanuel 2008), markets
for human organs (Hughes 1998; Taylor 2005), guest worker programs
(Mayer 2005), and price gouging (Zwolinski 2008). 
Some theorists, such as Philippe van Pairjs, have argued that justice
requires that the state institute a universal basic income (UBI). A
UBI is a cash transfer, funded by taxes, that would be paid to all
citizens regardless of need, and regardless of whether they are
working, or even willing to work (van Parijs 1995). Against this, some
critics have charged that a basic income would facilitate a form of
exploitation. As Stuart White argues, 
where others bear some cost in order to contribute to a scheme of
cooperation, then it is unfair for one to willingly enjoy the intended
benefits of their cooperative efforts unless one is willing to bear
the cost of making a relevantly proportionate contribution to this
scheme of cooperation in return. (White 1997: 317–318)
As is so often the case in dealing with exploitation claims, assessing
this objection requires us to grapple with a complicated mix of
empirical and normative claims. On the empirical side, for instance,
we might ask whether a basic income really would lead to a
net increase in reciprocity-violating transfers. Some theorists have
argued that a basic income would actually increase incentives to work
relative to currently existing welfare programs, by lowering the
effective marginal tax rate faced by low-wage workers (Tobin 1966).
Others have emphasized the role of unpaid labor in the economy, such
as domestic labor, and argued that a basic income would lead to a
fairer application of the reciprocity principle than welfare systems
that condition benefits on doing paid work (Pateman 2004).
Normatively, the objection challenges us to think about both what the
ideal of reciprocity requires and how it fits within a system of
broader distributive justice. Some advocates of basic income have
argued that a liberal-egalitarian theory of justice is correct and
requires an equal distribution of scarce resources such as land rent
and the rent component of wages (van Parijs 1997: 329). Reciprocity
may be an important political value, such theorists argue, but it is
one that is to be applied only after people have been given
what they are due at the basic level of justice.
The term “sweatshop” is usually used to refer places of
employment that utilize low-skill workers, often in the developing
world, and that are characterized by low wages, long hours, and unsafe
working conditions. In many cases, sweatshops produce goods on
contract for large, multinational enterprises, who then sell those
goods to customers in wealthier societies.
Many critics see sweatshop labor as highly exploitative. A large part
of the debate over this claim has focused on the issue of wages.
Critics claim that sweatshops have a moral obligation to pay a living
wage to their workers. This duty is grounded in the extreme need of
sweatshop workers, the fact that sweatshops and the multinational
enterprises with which they contract rely on them to produce the goods
that they sell, and the fact that the multinational enterprises are
profitable enough that they can afford to increase workers’
wages without jeopardizing the health of their business (Meyers 2004;
Snyder 2008). Some critics, however, see sweatshops’ low wages
as merely one symptom of a broader failure to respect workers as
persons who are ends in themselves. That failure of respect manifests
itself in sweatshops violation of legal labor standards, their
exposure of workers to physically dangerous conditions, and their
abuse and coercion of workers on the job (Arnold and Bowie 2003:
227–233).
Once again, a number of difficult empirical and normative issues come
out in this debate. The empirical issues include not only questions
about what conditions in sweatshops are actually like—how low
wages actually are relative to other firms in the developing economy,
for instance—but what effects various attempts to remedy
sweatshop conditions would actually have. Would a higher legal minimum
wage improve workers’ overall well-being, or would it instead
lead to layoffs and plant relocations (Powell and Zwolinski 2012)? On
the normative side, the Non-Worseness Condition seems to pose an
especially significant challenge to critics of sweatshop labor. If
sweatshops, by providing jobs and capital infusion in the developing
world, provide some benefit to workers there, how can they be
acting in a morally worse way than wealthy firms that do not outsource
their production at all, and thus provide no benefit to needy
workers abroad (Zwolinski 2007; Preiss 2014)? Another question: even
if we grant that sweatshops exploit their workers, and that
exploitation is a significant moral wrong, might it be a wrong that is
all-things-considered justifiable if sweatshop labor nevertheless
confers considerable benefits on current workers, and plays an
important role in economic growth? In other words, how much weight
should a valid claim of exploitation have in our overall judgment of
the justice of a practice or of a set of institutions that permit that
practice?
Commercial surrogacy is a practice in which a woman is paid to become
pregnant as a result of either artificial insemination or the
implantation of an already fertilized egg, and to surrender her
parental rights to the intended parent(s). In the United States, most
surrogacy arrangements are purely domestic affairs (with both the
intended parents and the surrogate being citizens of the United
States), but a significant number are international, in which the
surrogate mother is often a citizen of a much poorer country.
Both types of surrogacy arrangement have been subjected to criticism
on a number of distinct grounds. Some have argued that surrogacy
involves an objectionable form of “commodification”, while
others have argued that the practice is harmful to children, or to
women as a class. But many have also argued that the practice exploits
the women who serve as surrogates. In the case of international
surrogacy, this charge is usually based on the bad circumstances and
low pay of the women who serve as surrogates. The lack of alternative
sources of employment has been said to undermine women’s
consent, and the compensation they receive is often extremely low
compared to the pay received by American surrogates for the same
service—sometimes as low as 10%.
In the case of domestic surrogacy, critics charge that surrogate
mothers are young and do not fully understand the physical and
psychological risks that attend the services they are agreeing to
provide. As a result, the arrangement might be harmful on net to them
despite the fact that they consent to it. Or, even if it is not
harmful on net, the payment they receive might be inadequate
compensation for the costs they incur, thus rendering surrogacy a case
of mutually beneficial but unfair and exploitative exchange (Tong
1990).
Questions of fair compensation for surrogates raise many of the same
issues, and give rise to many of the same debates, as are found in the
literature on sweatshop labor (Wilkinson 2003). But unlike the sort of
labor that takes place in sweatshops, some critics believe that
commercial surrogacy arrangements are intrinsically wrong. If
women’s reproductive labor is not the sort of service that
should be sold at any price, then commercial surrogacy may
involve a kind of exploitation insofar as it entices women to engage
in an activity that is harmful to their moral character (Anderson
1990; Wertheimer 1996: Ch. 4).
