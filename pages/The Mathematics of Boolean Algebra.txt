 A Boolean algebra (BA) is a set \(A\) together with binary
operations + and \(\cdot\) and a unary operation \(-\), and elements
0, 1 of \(A\) such that the following laws hold: commutative and
associative laws for addition and multiplication, distributive laws
both for multiplication over addition and for addition over
multiplication, and the following special laws:
 These laws are better understood in terms of the basic example of a
BA, consisting of a collection \(A\) of subsets of a set \(X\) closed
under the operations of union, intersection, complementation with
respect to \(X\), with members \(\varnothing\) and \(X\). One can
easily derive many elementary laws from these axioms, keeping in mind
this example for motivation. Any BA has a natural partial order
\(\le\) defined upon it by saying that \(x \le y\) if and only if \(x
+ y = y\).  This corresponds in our main example to \(\subseteq\). Of
special importance is the two-element BA, formed by taking the set
\(X\) to have just one element. The two-element BA shows the direct
connection with elementary logic. The two members, 0 and 1, correspond
to falsity and truth respectively. The Boolean operations then express
the ordinary truth tables for disjunction (with \(+)\), conjunction
(with \(\cdot)\) and negation (with \(-)\). An important elementary
result is that an equation holds in all BAs if and only if it holds in
the two-element BA. Next, we define \(x \oplus y = (x \cdot -y) + (y
\cdot -x)\). Then \(A\) together with \(\oplus\) and \(\cdot\), along
with 0 and 1, forms a ring with identity in which every element is
idempotent. Conversely, given such a ring, with addition \(\oplus\)
and multiplication, define \(x + y = x \oplus y \oplus(x \cdot y)\)
and \(-x = 1 \oplus x\). This makes the ring into a BA. These two
processes are inverses of one another, and show that the theory of
Boolean algebras and of rings with identity in which every element is
idempotent are definitionally equivalent. This puts the theory of BAs
into a standard object of research in algebra. An atom in a BA is a
nonzero element \(a\) such that there is no element \(b\) with \(0 \lt
b \lt a\). A BA is atomic if every nonzero element of the BA is above
an atom. Finite BAs are atomic, but so are many infinite BAs. Under
the partial order \(\le\) above, \(x + y\) is the least upper bound of
\(x\) and \(y\), and \(x \cdot y\) is the greatest lower bound of
\(x\) and \(y\). We can generalize this: \(\Sigma X\) is the least
upper bound of a set \(X\) of elements, and \(\Pi X\) is the greatest
lower bound of a set \(X\) of elements. These do not exist for all
sets in all Boolean algebras; if they do always exist, the Boolean
algebra is said to be complete.
 Several algebraic constructions have obvious definitions and simple
properties for BAs: subalgebras, homomorphisms, isomorphisms, and
direct products (even of infinitely many algebras). Some other
standard algebraic constructions are more peculiar to BAs. An ideal in
a BA is a subset \(I\) closed under +, with 0 as a member, and such
that if \(a \le b \in I\), then also \(a \in I\). Although not
immediately obvious, this is the same as the ring-theoretic
concept. There is a dual notion of a filter (with no counterpart in
rings in general). A filter is a subset \(F\) closed under \(\cdot\) ,
having 1 as a member, and such that if \(a \ge b \in F\), then also
\(a \in F\). An ultrafilter on \(A\) is a filter \(F\) with the
following properties: \(0 \not\in F\), and for any \(a \in A\), either
\(a \in F\) or \(-a \in F\). For any \(a \in A\), let
 

Then \(S\) is an isomorphism onto a BA of subsets of the set \(X\) of
all ultrafilters on \(A\). This establishes the basic Stone
representation theorem, and clarifies the origin of BAs as concrete
algebras of sets. Moreover, the sets \(S(a)\) can be declared to be a
base for a topology on \(X\), and this turns \(X\) into a totally
disconnected compact Hausdorff space. This establishes a one-one
correspondence between the class of BAs and the class of such
spaces. As a consequence, used very much in the theory of BAs, many
topological theorems and concepts have consequences for BAs. If \(x\)
is an element of a BA, we let \(0x = -x\) and \(1x = x\). If
\((x\)(0), \(\ldots x(m - 1))\) is a finite sequence of elements of a
BA \(A\), then every element of the subalgebra of \(A\) generated by
\(\{x(0), \ldots, x(m - 1)\}\) can be written as a sum of monomials
\(e(0)x(0) \cdot \ldots \cdot e(m - 1)x(m - 1)\) for \(e\) in some set
of functions mapping \(m = \{0,\ldots , m - 1\}\) into \(2 = \{0,
1\}\). This is an algebraic expression of the disjunctive normal form
theorem of sentential logic. A function \(f\) from a set \(X\) of
generators of a BA \(A\) into a BA \(B\) can be extended to a
homomorphism if and only if
 always implies that 
This is Sikorski’s extension criterion. Every BA \(A\) can be
embedded in a complete BA \(B\) in such a way that every element of
\(B\) is the least upper bound of a set of elements of \(A\). \(B\) is
unique up to \(A\)-isomorphism, and is called the completion of
\(A\). If \(f\) is a homomorphism from a BA \(A\) into a complete BA
\(B\), and if \(A\) is a subalgebra of \(C\), then \(f\) can be
extended to a homomorphism of \(C\) into \(B\). This is
Sikorski’s extension theorem. Another general algebraic notion
which applies to Boolean algebras is the notion of a free
algebra. This can be concretely constructed for BAs. Namely, the free
BA on \(\kappa\) is the BA of closed-open subsets of the two element
discrete space raised to the \(\kappa\) power.
 There are many special classes of Boolean algebra which are important
both for the intrinsic theory of BAs and for
applications:
 Much of the deeper theory of Boolean algebras, telling about their
structure and classification, can be formulated in terms of certain
functions defined for all Boolean algebras, with infinite cardinals
as values. We define some of the more important of these cardinal
functions, and state some of the known structural facts, mostly
formulated in terms of them
 An important fact concerning cellularity is the Erdős-Tarski
theorem: if the cellularity of a BA is a singular cardinal, then there
actually is a set of disjoint elements of that size; for cellularity
regular limit (inaccessible), there are counterexamples. Every
infinite complete BA has an independent subset of the same size as the
algebra. Every infinite BA \(A\) has an irredundant incomparable
subset whose size is the \(\pi\)-weight of \(A\). Every interval
algebra has countable independence. A superatomic algebra does not
even have an infinite independent subset. Every tree algebra can be
embedded in an interval algebra. A BA with only the identity
automorphism is called rigid. There exist rigid complete BAs, also
rigid interval algebras and rigid tree algebras. 
More recently, many cardinal functions of min-max type have been
studied. For example, small independence is the smallest size of an
infinite maximal independent set; and small cellularity is the
smallest size of an infinite partition of unity.
 A basic result of Tarski is that the elementary theory of Boolean
algebras is decidable. Even the theory of Boolean algebras with a
distinguished ideal is decidable. On the other hand, the theory of a
Boolean algebra with a distinguished subalgebra is undecidable. Both
the decidability results and undecidablity results extend in various
ways to Boolean algebras in extensions of first-order logic.
 A very important construction, which carries over to many logics and
many algebras other than Boolean algebras, is the construction of a
Boolean algebra associated with the sentences in some logic. The
simplest case is sentential logic. Here there are sentence symbols,
and common connectives building up longer sentences from them:
disjunction, conjunction, and negation. Given a set \(A\) of sentences
in this language, two sentences \(s\) and \(t\) are equivalent modulo
\(A\) if and only if the biconditional between them is a logical
consequence of \(A\). The equivalence classes can be made into a BA
such that + corresponds to disjunction, \(\cdot\) to conjunction, and
\(-\) to negation. Any BA is isomorphic to one of this form. One can
do something similar for a first-order theory. Let \(T\) be a
first-order theory in a first-order language \(L\). We call formulas
\(\phi\) and \(\psi\) equivalent provided that \(T \vdash \phi
\leftrightarrow \psi\).  The equivalence class of a sentence \(\phi\)
is denoted by [\(\phi\)]. Let \(A\) be the collection of all
equivalence classes under this equivalence relation. We can make \(A\)
into a BA by the following definitions, which are easily
justified:
 Every BA is isomorphic to a Lindenbaum-Tarski
algebra. However, one of the most important uses of these classical
Lindenbaum-Tarski algebras is to describe them for important theories
(usually decidable theories). For countable languages this can be
done by describing their isomorphic interval algebras. Generally this
gives a thorough knowledge of the theory. Some examples are:
 In model theory, one can take values in any complete BA rather than
the two-element BA. This Boolean-valued model theory was developed
around 1950–1970, but has not been worked on much since. But a
special case, Boolean-valued models for set theory, is very much at
the forefront of current research in set theory. It actually forms an
equivalent way of looking at the forcing construction of Cohen, and
has some technical advantages and disadvantages. Philosophically it
seems more satisfactory than the forcing concept. We describe this
set theory case here; it will then become evident why only complete
BAs are considered. Let B be a complete BA. First we define the
Boolean valued universe \(V(B)\). The ordinary
set-theoretic universe can be identified with \(V\)(2), where 2
is the 2-element BA. The definition is by transfinite recursion, where
\(\alpha , \beta\) are ordinals and \(\lambda\) is a limit ordinal:
where \(\dom(f)\) is the domain of function \(f\) and \(\range(f)\) is
the range of function \(f\). The \(B\)-valued universe is the proper
class \(V(B)\) which is the union of all of these \(V\)s. Next, one
defines by a rather complicated transfinite recursion over
well-founded sets the value of a set-theoretic formula with elements
of the Boolean valued universe assigned to its free variables:
