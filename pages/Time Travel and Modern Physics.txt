You are very depressed. You are suicidally depressed. You have a
gun. But you do not quite have the courage to point the gun at yourself
and kill yourself in this way. If only someone else would kill you,
that would be a good thing. But you can't really ask someone to kill
you. That wouldn't be fair. You decide that if you remain this
depressed and you find a time machine, you will travel back in time to
just about now, and kill your earlier self. That would be good. In that
way you even would get rid of the depressing time you will spend
between now and when you would get into that time machine. You start to
muse about the coherence of this idea, when something amazing happens.
Out of nowhere you suddenly see someone coming towards you with a gun
pointed at you. In fact he looks very much like you, except that he is
bleeding badly from his left eye, and can barely stand up straight. You
are at peace. You look straight at him, calmly. He shoots. You feel a
searing pain in your left eye. Your mind is in chaos, you stagger
around and accidentally enter a strange looking cubicle. You drift off
into unconsciousness. After a while, you can not tell how long, you
drift back into consciousness and stagger out of the cubicle. You see
someone in the distance looking at you calmly and fixedly. You realize
that it is your younger self. He looks straight at you. You are in
terrible pain. You have to end this, you have to kill him, really kill
him once and for all. You shoot him, but your eyesight is so bad that
your aim is off. You do not kill him, you merely damage his left eye.
He staggers off. You fall to the ground in agony, and decide to study
the paradoxes of time travel more seriously.
The standard worry about time travel is that it allows one to go
back and kill one's younger self and thereby create paradox. More
generally it allows for people or objects to travel back in time and to
cause events in the past that are inconsistent with what in fact
happened. (See e.g., Gödel 1949, Earman 1972, Malament
1985a&b, Horwich 1987.) A stone-walling response to this worry is
that by logic indeed inconsistent events can not both happen. Thus in
fact all such schemes to create paradox are logically bound to fail. So
what's the worry?
Well, one worry is the question as to why such schemes always fail.
Doesn't the necessity of such failures put prima facie unusual
and unexpected constraints on the actions of people, or objects, that
have traveled in time? Don't we have good reason to believe that there
are no such constraints (in our world) and thus that there is no time
travel (in our world)? We will later return to the issue of the
palatability of such constraints, but first we want to discuss an
argument that no constraints are imposed by time travel.
Wheeler and Feynman (1949) were the first to claim that the fact
that nature is continuous could be used to argue that causal influences
from later events to earlier events, as are made possible by time
travel, will not lead to paradox without the need for any constraints.
Maudlin (1990) showed how to make their argument precise and more
general, and argued that nonetheless it was not completely general.
Imagine the following set-up. We start off having a camera with a
black and white film ready to take a picture of whatever comes out of
the time machine. An object, in fact a developed film, comes out of the
time machine. We photograph it, and develop the film. The developed
film is subsequently put in the time machine, and set to come out of
the time machine at the time the picture is taken. This surely will
create a paradox: the developed film will have the opposite
distribution of black, white, and shades of gray, from the object that
comes out of the time machine. For developed black and white films
(i.e. negatives) have the opposite shades of gray from the objects they
are pictures of. But since the object that comes out of the time
machine is the developed film itself it we surely have a paradox.
However, it does not take much thought to realize that there is no
paradox here. What will happen is that a uniformly gray picture will
emerge, which produces a developed film that has exactly the same
uniform shade of gray. No matter what the sensitivity of the film is,
as long as the dependence of the brightness of the developed film
depends in a continuous manner on the brightness of the object being
photographed, there will be a shade of gray that, when photographed,
will produce exactly the same shade of gray on the developed film. This
is the essence of Wheeler and Feynman's idea. Let us first be a bit
more precise and then a bit more general.
For simplicity let us suppose that the film is always a uniform
shade of gray (i.e. at any time the shade of gray does not vary by
location on the film). The possible shades of gray of the film can then
be represented by the (real) numbers from 0, representing pure black,
to 1, representing pure white.
Let us now distinguish various stages in the chronogical order of
the life of the film. In stage S1 the film is
young; it has just been placed in the camera and is ready to be
exposed. It is then exposed to the object that comes out of the time
machine. (That object in fact is a later stage of the film itself). By
the time we come to stage S2 of the life of the
film, it has been developed and is about to enter the time machine.
Stage S3 occurs just after it exits the time
machine and just before it is photographed. Stage
S4 occurs after it has been photographed and before
it starts fading away. Let us assume that the film starts out in stage
S1 in some uniform shade of gray, and that the only
significant change in the shade of gray of the film occurs between
stages S1 and S2. During that
period it acquires a shade of gray that depends on the shade of gray of
the object that was photographed. I.e., the shade of gray that the film
acquires at stage S2 depends on the shade of gray
it has at stage S3. The influence of the shade of
gray of the film at stage S3, on the shade of gray
of the film at stage S2, can be represented as a
mapping, or function, from the real numbers between 0 and 1
(inclusive), to the real numbers between 0 and 1 (inclusive). Let us
suppose that the process of photography is such that if one imagines
varying the shade of gray of an object in a smooth, continuous manner
then the shade of gray of the developed picture of that object will
also vary in a smooth, continuous manner. This implies that the
function in question will be a continuous function. Now any continuous
function from the real numbers between 0 and 1 (inclusive) to the real
numbers between 0 and 1 (inclusive) must map at least one number to
itself. One can quickly convince oneself of this by graphing such
functions. For one will quickly see that any continuous function f from
[0,1] to [0,1] must intersect the line x=y somewhere,
and thus there must be at least one point x such that
f(x)=x. Such points are called fixed points
of the function. Now let us think about what such a fixed point
represents. It represents a shade of gray such that, when photographed,
it will produce a developed film with exactly that same shade of gray.
The existence of such a fixed point implies a solution to the apparent
paradox.
Let us now be more general and allow color photography. One can
represent each possible color of an object (of uniform color) by the
proportions of blue, green and red that make up that color. (This is
why television screens can produce all possible colors.) Thus one can
represent all possible colors of an object by three points on three
orthogonal lines x, y and z, that is to say,
by a point in a three-dimensional cube. This cube is also known as the
‘Cartesian product’ of the three line segments. Now, one
can also show that any continuous map from such a cube to itself must
have at least one fixed point. So color photography can not be used to
create time travel paradoxes either!
Even more generally, consider some system P which, as in
the above example, has the following life. It starts in some state
S1, it interacts with an object that comes out of a
time machine (which happens to be its older self), it travels back in
time, it interacts with some object (which happens to be its younger
self), and finally it grows old and dies. Let us assume that the set of
possible states of P can be represented by a Cartesian product
of n closed intervals of the reals, i.e., let us assume that
the topology of the state-space of P is isomorphic to a finite
Cartesian product of closed intervals of the reals. Let us further
assume that the development of P in time, and the dependence
of that development on the state of objects that it interacts with, is
continuous. Then, by a well-known fixed point theorem in topology (see
e.g., Hocking and Young 1961, p 273), no matter what the nature of the
interaction is, and no matter what the initial state of the object is,
there will be at least one state S3 of the older
system (as it emerges from the time travel machine) that will influence
the initial state S1 of the younger system (when it
encounters the older system) so that, as the younger system becomes
older, it develops exactly into state S3. Thus
without imposing any constraints on the initial state
S1 of the system P, we have shown that
there will always be perfectly ordinary, non-paradoxical, solutions, in
which everything that happens, happens according to the usual laws of
development. Of course, there is looped causation, hence presumably
also looped explanation, but what do you expect if there is looped
time?
Unfortunately, for the fan of time travel, a little reflection
suggests that there are systems for which the needed fixed point
theorem does not hold. Imagine, for instance, that we have a dial that
can only rotate in a plane. We are going to put the dial in the time
machine. Indeed we have decided that if we see the later stage of the
dial come out of the time machine set at angle x, then we will
set the dial to x+90, and throw it into the time machine. Now
it seems we have a paradox, since the mapping that consists of a
rotation of all points in a circular state-space by 90 degrees does not
have a fixed point. And why wouldn't some state-spaces have the
topology of a circle?
However, we have so far not used another continuity assumption which
is also a reasonable assumption. So far we have only made the following
demand: the state the dial is in at stage S2 must
be a continuous function of the state of the dial at stage
S3. But, the state of the dial at stage
S2 is arrived at by taking the state of the dial at
stage S1, and rotating it over some angle. It is
not merely the case that the effect of the interaction, namely the
state of the dial at stage S2, should be a
continuous function of the cause, namely the state of the dial at stage
S3. It is additionally the case that path taken to
get there, the way the dial is rotated between stages
S1 and S2 must be a continuous
function of the state at stage S3. And, rather
surprisingly, it turns out that this can not be done. Let us illustrate
what the problem is before going to a more general demonstration that
there must be a fixed point solution in the dial case.
Forget time travel for the moment. Suppose that you and I each have
a watch with a single dial neither of which is running. My watch is set
at 12. You are going to announce what your watch is set at. My task is
going to be to adjust my watch to yours no matter what announcement you
make. And my actions should have a continuous (single valued)
dependence on the time that you announce. Surprisingly, this is not
possible! For instance, suppose that if you announce “12”,
then I achieve that setting on my watch by doing nothing. Now imagine
slowly and continuously increasing the announced times, starting at 12.
By continuity, I must achieve each of those settings by rotating my
dial to the right. If at some point I switch and achieve the announced
goal by a rotation of my dial to the left, I will have introduced a
discontinuity in my actions, a discontinuity in the actions that I take
as a function of the announced angle. So I will be forced, by
continuity, to achieve every announcement by rotating the dial to the
right. But, this rotation to the right will have to be abruptly
discontinued as the announcements grow larger and I eventually approach
12 again, since I achieved 12 by not rotating the dial at all. So,
there will be a discontinuity at 12 at the latest. In general,
continuity of my actions as a function of announced times can not be
maintained throughout if I am to be able to replicate all possible
settings. Another way to see the problem is that one can similarly
reason that, as one starts with 12, and imagines continuously making
the announced times earlier, one will be forced, by continuity, to
achieve the announced times by rotating the dial to the left. But the
conclusions drawn from the assumption of continuous increases and the
assumption of continuous decreases are inconsistent. So we have an
inconsistency following from the assumption of continuity and the
assumption that I always manage to set my watch to your watch. So, a
dial developing according to a continuous dynamics from a given initial
state, can not be set up so as to react to a second dial, with which it
interacts, in such a way that it is guaranteed to always end up set at
the same angle as the second dial. Similarly, it can not be set up so
that it is guaranteed to always end up set at 90 degrees to the setting
of the second dial. All of this has nothing to do with time travel.
However, the impossibility of such set ups is what prevents us from
enacting the rotation by 90 degrees that would create paradox in the
time travel setting.
Let us now give the positive result that with such dials there will
always be fixed point solutions, as long as the dynamics is continuous.
Let us call the state of the dial before it interacts with its older
self the initial state of the dial. And let us call the state of the
dial after it emerges from the time machine the final state of the
dial. We can represent the possible initial and final states of the
dial by the angles x and y that the dial can point at
initially and finally. The set of possible initial plus final states
thus forms a torus. (See figure 1.)
Suppose that the dial starts at angle I. The initial angle
I that the dial is at before it encounters its older self, and
the set of all possible final angles that the dial can have when it
emerges from the time machine is represented by the circle I
on the torus (see figure 1). Given any possible angle of the emerging
dial the dial initially at angle I will develop to some other
angle. One can picture this development by rotating each point on
I in the horizontal direction by the relevant amount. Since
the rotation has to depend continuously on the angle of the emerging
dial, ring I during this development will deform into some
loop L on the torus. Loop L thus represents the angle
x that the dial is at when it is thrown into the time machine,
given that it started at angle I and then encountered a dial
(its older self) which was at angle y when it emerged from the
time machine. We therefore have consistency if x=y
for some x and y on loop L. Now, let loop
C be the loop which consists of all the points on the torus
for which x=y. Ring I intersects C
at point <i,i>. Obviously any continuous
deformation of I must still intersect C somewhere. So
L must intersect C somewhere, say at
<j,j>. But that means that no matter how the
development of the dial starting at I depends on the angle of
the emerging dial, there will be some angle for the emerging dial such
that the dial will develop exactly into that angle (by the time it
enters the time machine) under the influence of that emerging dial.
This is so no matter what angle one starts with, and no matter how the
development depends on the angle of the emerging dial. Thus even for a
circular state-space there are no constraints needed other than
continuity.
Unfortunately there are state-spaces that escape even this argument.
Consider for instance a pointer that can be set to all values between 0
and 1, where 0 and 1 are not possible values. That is, suppose that we
have a state-space that is isomorphic to an open set of real numbers.
Now suppose that we have a machine that sets the pointer to half the
value that the pointer is set at when it emerges from the time
machine.
Suppose the pointer starts at value I. As before we can
represent the combination of this initial position and all possible
final positions by the line I. Under the influence of the
pointer coming out of the time machine the pointer value will develop
to a value that equals half the value of the final value that it
encountered. We can represent this development as the continuous
deformation of line I into line L, which is indicated
by the arrows in Figure 2. This development is fully continuous. Points
<x,y> on line I represent the initial
position x=I of the (young) pointer, and the position
y of the older pointer as it emerges from the time machine. Points
<x,y> on line L represent the position
x that the younger pointer should develop into, given that it
encountered the older pointer emerging from the time machine set at
position y. Since the pointer is designed to develop to half
the value of the pointer that it encounters, the line L
corresponds to x=1/2y. We have
consistency if there is some point such that it develops into that
point, if it encounters that point. Thus, we have consistency if there
is some point <x,y> on line L such
that x=y. However, there is no such point: lines
L and C do not intersect. Thus there is no consistent
solution, despite the fact that the dynamics is fully continuous.
Of course if 0 were a possible value L and C would
intersect at 0. This is surprising and strange: adding one point to the
set of possible values of a quantity here makes the difference between
paradox and peace. One might be tempted to just add the extra point to
the state-space in order to avoid problems. After all, one might say,
surely no measurements could ever tell us whether the set of possible
values includes that exact point or not. Unfortunately there can be
good theoretical reasons for supposing that some quantity has a
state-space that is open: the set of all possible speeds of massive
objects in special relativity surely is an open set, since it includes
all speeds up to, but not including, the speed of light. Quantities
that have possible values that are not bounded also lead to counter
examples to the presented fixed point argument. And it is not obvious
to us why one should exclude such possibilities. So the argument that
no constraints are needed is not fully general.
An interesting question of course is: exactly for which state-spaces
must there be such fixed points. We do not know the general answer.
(But see Kutach 2003 for more on this issue.)
Time travel has recently been discussed quite extensively in the
context of general relativity. Time travel can occur in general
relativistic models in which one has closed time-like curves (CTC's). A
time like curve is simply a space-time trajectory such that the speed
of light is never equalled or exceeded along this trajectory. Time-like
curves thus represent the possible trajectories of ordinary objects. If
there were time-like curves which were closed (formed a loop), then
travelling along such a curve one would never exceed the speed of
light, and yet after a certain amount of (proper) time one would return
to a point in space-time that one previously visited. Or, by staying
close to such a CTC, one could come arbitrarily close to a point in
space-time that one previously visited. General relativity, in a
straightforward sense, allows time travel: there appear to be many
space-times compatible with the fundamental equations of General
Relativity in which there are CTC's. Space-time, for instance, could
have a Minkowski metric everywhere, and yet have CTC's everywhere by
having the temporal dimension (topologically) rolled up as a circle.
Or, one can have wormhole connections between different parts of
space-time which allow one to enter ‘mouth A’ of
such a wormhole connection, travel through the wormhole, exit the
wormhole at ‘mouth B’ and re-enter ‘mouth
A’ again. Or, one can have space-times which
topologically are R4, and yet have CTC's due to the
‘tilting’ of light cones (Gödel space-times, Taub-NUT
space-times, etc.)
General relativity thus appears to provide ample opportunity for
time travel. Note that just because there are CTC's in a space-time,
this does not mean that one can get from any point in the space-time to
any other point by following some future directed timelike curve. In
many space-times in which there are CTC's such CTC's do not occur all
over space-time. Some parts of space-time can have CTC's while other
parts do not. Let us call the part of a space-time that has CTC's the
“time travel region" of that space-time, while calling the rest
of that space-time the "normal region". More precisely, the “time
travel region" consists of all the space-time points p such
that there exists a (non-zero length) timelike curve that starts at
p and returns to p. Now let us start examining
space-times with CTC's a bit more closely for potential problems.
In order to get a feeling for the sorts of implications that closed
timelike curves can have, it may be useful to consider two simple
models. In space-times with closed timelike curves the traditional
initial value problem cannot be framed in the usual way. For it
presupposes the existence of Cauchy surfaces, and if there are CTCs
then no Cauchy surface exists. (A Cauchy surface is a spacelike surface
such that every inextendible timelike curve crosses it exactly once.
One normally specifies initial conditions by giving the conditions on
such a surface.) Nonetheless, if the topological complexities of the
manifold are appropriately localized, we can come quite close. Let us
call an edgeless spacelike surface S a quasi-Cauchy
surface if it divides the rest of the manifold into two parts such that
a) every point in the manifold can be connected by a timelike curve to
S, and b) any timelike curve which connects a point in one
region to a point in the other region intersects S exactly
once. It is obvious that a quasi-Cauchy surface must entirely inhabit
the normal region of the space-time; if any point p of
S is in the time travel region, then any timelike curve which
intersects p can be extended to a timelike curve which
intersects S near p again. In extreme cases of time
travel, a model may have no normal region at all (e.g., Minkowski
space-time rolled up like a cylinder in a time-like direction), in
which case our usual notions of temporal precedence will not apply. But
temporal anomalies like wormholes (and time machines) can be
sufficiently localized to permit the existence of quasi-Cauchy
surfaces.
Given a timelike orientation, a quasi-Cauchy surface
unproblematically divides the manifold into its past (i.e.,
all points that can be reached by past-directed timelike curves from
S) and its future (ditto mutatis mutandis).
If the whole past of S is in the normal region of the
manifold, then S is a partial Cauchy surface: every
inextendible timelike curve which exists to the past of S
intersects S exactly once, but (if there is time travel in the
future) not every inextendible timelike curve which exists to the
future of S intersects S. Now we can ask a
particularly clear question: consider a manifold which contains a time
travel region, but also has a partial Cauchy surface S, such
that all of the temporal funny business is to the future of S.
If all you could see were S and its past, you would not know
that the space-time had any time travel at all. The question is: are
there any constraints on the sort of data which can be put on
S and continued to a global solution of the dynamics which are
different from the constraints (if any) on the data which can be put on
a Cauchy surface in a simply connected manifold and continued to a
global solution? If there is time travel to our future, might we we
able to tell this now, because of some implied oddity in the
arrangement of present things?
It is not at all surprising that there might be constraints on the
data which can be put on a locally space-like surface which passes
through the time travel region: after all, we never think we can freely
specify what happens on a space-like surface and on another such
surface to its future, but in this case the surface at issue lies to
its own future. But if there were particular constraints for data on a
partial Cauchy surface then we would apparently need to have to rule
out some sorts of otherwise acceptable states on S if there is
to be time travel to the future of S. We then might be able to
establish that there will be no time travel in the future by simple
inspection of the present state of the universe. As we will see, there
is reason to suspect that such constraints on the partial Cauchy
surface are non-generic. But we are getting ahead of ourselves: first
let's consider the effect of time travel on a very simple dynamics.
The simplest possible example is the Newtonian theory of perfectly
elastic collisions among equally massive particles in one spatial
dimension. The space-time is two-dimensional, so we can represent it
initially as the Euclidean plane, and the dynamics is completely
specified by two conditions. When particles are traveling freely, their
world lines are straight lines in the space-time, and when two
particles collide, they exchange momenta, so the collision looks like
an ‘X’ in space-time, with each particle changing
its momentum at the
 impact.[1]
 The dynamics is purely local, in that one
can check that a set of world-lines constitutes a model of the dynamics
by checking that the dynamics is obeyed in every arbitrarily small
region. It is also trivial to generate solutions from arbitrary initial
data if there are no CTCs: given the initial positions and momenta of a
set of particles, one simply draws a straight line from each particle
in the appropriate direction and continues it indefinitely. Once all
the lines are drawn, the worldline of each particle can be traced from
collision to collision. The boundary value problem for this dynamics is
obviously well-posed: any set of data at an instant yields a unique
global solution, constructed by the method sketched above.
What happens if we change the topology of the space-time by hand to
produce CTCs? The simplest way to do this is depicted in figure 3: we
cut and paste the space-time so it is no longer simply connected by
identifying the line L− with the line L+.
Particles “going in” to L+ from below
“emerge” from L− , and particles
“going in” to L− from below
“emerge” from L+.
How is the boundary-value problem changed by this alteration in the
space-time? Before the cut and paste, we can put arbitrary data on the
simultaneity slice S and continue it to a unique solution.
After the change in topology, S is no longer a Cauchy surface,
since a CTC will never intersect it, but it is a partial Cauchy
surface. So we can ask two questions. First, can arbitrary data on
S always be continued to a global solution? Second, is that
solution unique? If the answer to the first question is no,
then we have a backward-temporal constraint: the existence of the
region with CTCs places constraints on what can happen on S
even though that region lies completely to the future of S. If
the answer to the second question is no, then we have an odd
sort of indeterminism: the complete physical state on S does
not determine the physical state in the future, even though the local
dynamics is perfectly deterministic and even though there is no other
past edge to the space-time region in S's future (i.e., there
is nowhere else for boundary values to come from which could
influence the state of the region).
In this case the answer to the first question is yes and to
the second is no: there are no constraints on the data which
can be put on S, but those data are always consistent with an
infinitude of different global solutions. The easy way to see that
there always is a solution is to construct the minimal solution in the
following way. Start drawing straight lines from S as required
by the initial data. If a line hits L− from the bottom,
just continue it coming out of the top of L+ in the
appropriate place, and if a line hits L+ from the bottom,
continue it emerging from L− at the appropriate place.
Figure 4 represents the minimal solution for a single particle which
enters the time-travel region from the left:
The particle ‘travels back in time’ three times. It is
obvious that this minimal solution is a global solution, since the
particle always travels inertially.
But the same initial state on S is also consistent with
other global solutions. The new requirement imposed by the topology is
just that the data going into L+ from the bottom match the
data coming out of L− from the top, and the data going
into L- from the bottom match the data coming out of
L+ from the top. So we can add any number of vertical lines
connecting L- and L+ to a solution and still have a
solution. For example, adding a few such lines to the minimal solution
yields:
The particle now collides with itself twice: first before it reaches
L+ for the first time, and again shortly before it exits the
CTC region. From the particle's point of view, it is traveling to the
right at a constant speed until it hits an older version of itself and
comes to rest. It remains at rest until it is hit from the right by a
younger version of itself, and then continues moving off, and the same
process repeats later. It is clear that this is a global model of the
dynamics, and that any number of distinct models could be generating by
varying the number and placement of vertical lines.
Knowing the data on S, then, gives us only incomplete
information about how things will go for the particle. We know that the
particle will enter the CTC region, and will reach L+, we know
that it will be the only particle in the universe, we know exactly
where and with what speed it will exit the CTC region. But we cannot
determine how many collisions the particle will undergo (if any), nor
how long (in proper time) it will stay in the CTC region. If the
particle were a clock, we could not predict what time it would indicate
when exiting the region. Furthermore, the dynamics gives us no handle
on what to think of the various possibilities: there are no
probabilities assigned to the various distinct possible outcomes.
Changing the topology has changed the mathematics of the situation
in two ways, which tend to pull in opposite directions. On the one
hand, S is no longer a Cauchy surface, so it is perhaps not
surprising that data on S do not suffice to fix a unique
global solution. But on the other hand, there is an added constraint:
data “coming out” of L− must exactly match
data “going in” to L+, even though what comes out
of L− helps to determine what goes into L+.
This added consistency constraint tends to cut down on solutions,
although in this case the additional constraint is more than outweighed
by the freedom to consider various sorts of data on
L+/L-.
The fact that the extra freedom outweighs the extra constraint also
points up one unexpected way that the supposed paradoxes of time travel
may be overcome. Let's try to set up a paradoxical situation using the
little closed time loop above. If we send a single particle into the
loop from the left and do nothing else, we know exactly where it will
exit the right side of the time travel region. Now suppose we station
someone at the other side of the region with the following charge: if
the particle should come out on the right side, the person is to do
something to prevent the particle from going in on the left in
the first place. In fact, this is quite easy to do: if we send a
particle in from the right, it seems that it can exit on the left and
deflect the incoming left-hand particle.
Carrying on our reflection in this way, we further realize that if
the particle comes out on the right, we might as well send it
back in order to deflect itself from entering in the first place. So
all we really need to do is the following: set up a perfectly
reflecting particle mirror on the right-hand side of the time travel
region, and launch the particle from the left so that—if
nothing interferes with it—it will just barely hit
L+. Our paradox is now apparently complete. If, on the one
hand, nothing interferes with the particle it will enter the
time-travel region on the left, exit on the right, be reflected from
the mirror, re-enter from the right, and come out on the left to
prevent itself from ever entering. So if it enters, it gets deflected
and never enters. On the other hand, if it never enters then nothing
goes in on the left, so nothing comes out on the right, so nothing is
reflected back, and there is nothing to deflect it from entering. So if
it doesn't enter, then there is nothing to deflect it and it enters. If
it enters, then it is deflected and doesn't enter; if it doesn't enter
then there is nothing to deflect it and it enters: paradox
complete.
But at least one solution to the supposed paradox is easy to
construct: just follow the recipe for constructing the minimal
solution, continuing the initial trajectory of the particle (reflecting
it the mirror in the obvious way) and then read of the number and
trajectories of the particles from the resulting diagram. We get the
result of figure 6:
As we can see, the particle approaching from the left never reaches
L+: it is deflected first by a particle which emerges from
L-. But it is not deflected by itself, as the paradox
suggests, it is deflected by another particle. Indeed, there are now
four particles in the diagram: the original particle and three
particles which are confined to closed time-like curves. It is not the
leftmost particle which is reflected by the mirror, nor even the
particle which deflects the leftmost particle; it is another particle
altogether.
The paradox gets it traction from an incorrect presupposition: if
there is only one particle in the world at S then there is
only one particle which could participate in an interaction in the time
travel region: the single particle would have to interact with its
earlier (or later) self. But there is no telling what might come out of
L− : the only requirement is that whatever comes out
must match what goes in at L+. So if you go to the trouble of
constructing a working time machine, you should be prepared for a
different kind of disappointment when you attempt to go back and kill
yourself: you may be prevented from entering the machine in the first
place by some completely unpredictable entity which emerges from it.
And once again a peculiar sort of indeterminism appears: if there are
many self-consistent things which could prevent you from entering,
there is no telling which is even likely to materialize.
So when the freedom to put data on L− outweighs the
constraint that the same data go into L+, instead of paradox
we get an embarrassment of riches: many solution consistent with the
data on S. To see a case where the constraint
“outweighs” the freedom, we need to construct a very
particular, and frankly artificial, dynamics and topology. Consider the
space of all linear dynamics for a scalar field on a lattice. (The
lattice can be though of as a simple discrete space-time.) We will
depict the space-time lattice as a directed graph. There is to be a
scalar field defined at every node of the graph, whose value at a given
node depends linearly on the values of the field at nodes which have
arrows which lead to it. Each edge of the graph can be assigned a
weighting factor which determines how much the field at the input node
contributes to the field at the output node. If we name the nodes by
the letters a, b, c, etc., and the edges by
their endpoints in the obvious way, then we can label the weighting
factors by the edges they are associated with in an equally obvious
way.
Suppose that the graph of the space-time lattice is
acyclic, as in figure 7. (A graph is Acyclic if one
can not travel in the direction of the arrows and go in a loop.)
It is easy to regard a set of nodes as the analog of a Cauchy
surface, e.g., the set {a, b, c}, and it is
obvious if arbitrary data are put on those nodes the data will generate
a unique solution in the
 future.[2]
 If the value of the
field at node a is 3 and at node b is 7, then its
value at node d will be 3Wad and
its value at node e will be 3Wae
+ 7Wbe. By varying the weighting factors
we can adjust the dynamics, but in an acyclic graph the future
evolution of the field will always be unique.
Let us now again artificially alter the topology of the lattice to
admit CTCs, so that the graph now is cyclic. One of the simplest such
graphs is depicted in figure 8: there are now paths which lead from
z back to itself, e.g., z to y to
z.
Can we now put arbitrary data on v and w, and
continue that data to a global solution? Will the solution be
unique?
In the generic case, there will be a solution and the solution will
be unique. The equations for the value of the field at x,
y, and z are:
Solving these equations for z yields
z =
(vWvxWxz
+
wWwyWyz)/
(1 − WzxWxz
−
WzyWyz),
which gives a unique value for z in the generic case. But
looking at the space of all possible dynamics for this lattice (i.e.,
the space of all possible weighting factors), we find a singularity in
the case where
1−WzxWxz −
WzyWyz = 0.
If we choose weighting factors in just this way, then arbitrary data at
v and w cannot be continued to a global solution.
Indeed, if the scalar field is everywhere non-negative, then this
particular choice of dynamics puts ironclad constraints on the value of
the field at v and w: the field there must be zero
(assuming Wvx and Wwy to be
non-zero), and similarly all nodes in their past must have field value
zero. If the field can take negative values, then the values at
v and w must be so chosen that
vWvxWxz
=
−wWwyWyz.
In either case, the field values at v and w are
severely constrained by the existence of the CTC region even though
these nodes lie completely to the past of that region. It is this sort
of constraint which we find to be unlike anything which appears in
standard physics.
Our toy models suggest three things. The first is that it may be
impossible to prove in complete generality that arbitrary data on a
partial Cauchy surface can always be continued to a global
solution: our artificial case provides an example where it cannot. The
second is that such odd constraints are not likely to be generic: we
had to delicately fine-tune the dynamics to get a problem. The third is
that the opposite problem, namely data on a partial Cauchy surface
being consistent with many different global solutions, is
likely to be generic: we did not have to do any fine-tuning to get this
result. And this leads to a peculiar sort of indeterminism: the entire
state on S does not determine what will happen in the future
even though the local dynamics is deterministic and there are no other
“edges” to space-time from which data could influence the
result. What happens in the time travel region is constrained but not
determined by what happens on S, and the dynamics does not
even supply any probabilities for the various possibilities.
The example of the photographic negative discussed in section 3, then,
seems likely to be unusual, for in that case there is a unique
fixed point for the dynamics, and the set-up plus the dynamical laws
determine the outcome. In the generic case one would rather
expect multiple fixed points, with no room for anything to
influence, even probabilistically, which would be
realized.
It is ironic that time travel should lead generically not to
contradictions or to constraints (in the normal region) but to
underdetermination of what happens in the time travel region
by what happens everywhere else (an underdetermination tied neither to
a probabilistic dynamics or to a free edge to space-time). The
traditional objection to time travel is that it leads to
contradictions: there is no consistent way to complete an arbitrarily
constructed story about how the time traveler intends to act. Instead,
though, it appears that the problem is underdetermination: the story
can be consistently completed in many different ways.
The two toys models presented above have the virtue of being
mathematically tractable, but they involve certain simplifications and
potential problems that lead to trouble if one tries to make them more
complicated. Working through these difficulties will help highlight the
conditions we have made use of.
Consider a slight modification of the first simple model proposed to
us by Adam Elga. Let the particles have an electric charge,
which produces forces according to Coulomb’s law. Then set up a
situation like that depicted in figure 9:
Figure 9: Set-up for Elga's Paradox
The dotted line indicates the path the particle will follow if no
forces act upon it. The point labeled P is the left edge of
the time-travel region; the two labels are a reminder that the point at
the bottom and the point at the top are one and the same.
Elga's paradox is as follows: if no force acts on the particle, then
it will enter the time-travel region. But if it enters the time travel
region, and hence reappears along the bottom edge, then its later self
will interact electrically with its earlier self, and the earlier self
will be deflected away from the time-travel region. It is easy to set
up the case so that the deflection will be enough to keep the particle
from ever entering the time-travel region in the first place. (For
instance, let the momentum of the incoming particle towards the time
travel region be very small. The mere existence of an identically
charged particle inside the time travel region will then be sufficient
to deflect the incoming particle so that it never reaches
L+.) But, of course, if the particle never enters
the region at all, then it will not be there to deflect
itself….
One might suspect that some complicated collection of charged
particles in the time-travel-region can save the day, as it did with
our mirror-reflection problem above. But (unless there are infinitely
many such particles) this can't work, as conservation of particle
number and linear momentum show. Suppose that some finite collection of
particles emerges from L- and supplies the
repulsive electric force needed to deflect the incoming particle. Then
exactly the same collection of particles must be “absorbed”
at L+. So at all times after
L+, the only particle there is in the world is the
incoming particle, which has now been deflected away from its original
trajectory.
The deflection, though, means that the linear momentum of the
particle has changed from what is was before L-.
But that is impossible, by conservation of linear momementum. No matter
how the incoming particle interacts with particles in the time-travel
region, or how those particle interact with each other, total linear
momentum is conserved by the interaction. And whatever net linear
momentum the time-travelling particles have when they emerge from
L-, that much linear momentum most be absorbed at
L+. So the momentum of the incoming particle can't
be changed by the interaction: the particle can't have been deflected.
(One could imagine trying to create a sort of “S” curve in
the trajectory of the incoming particle, first bending to the left and
then to the right, which leaves its final momentum equal to its initial
momentum, but moving it over in space so it misses
L+. However, if the force at issue is repulsive,
then the bending back to the right can't be done. In the mirror example
above, the path of the incoming particle can be changed without
violating the conservation of momentum because at the end of the
process momentum has been transferred to the mirror.)
How does Elga's example escape our analysis? Why can't a contintuity
principle guarantee the existence of a solution here?
The continuity assumption breaks down because of two features of the
example: the concentration of the electric charge on a point particle,
and the way we have treated (or, more accurately, failed to treat) the
point P, the edge of L+ (and
L-). We have assumed that a point particle either
hits L+, and then emerges from
L-, or else it misses L+ and
sails on into the region of space-time above it. This means that the
charge on the incoming particle only has two possibilities: either it
is transported whole back in time or it completely avoids time travel
altogether. Let's see how it alters the situation to imagine the charge
itself to be continuous divisible.
Suppose that, instead of being concentrated at a point, the incoming
object is a little stick, with electric charge distributed even across
it (figure 10).
Figure 10: Elga's Paradox with a Charged Bar
Once again, we set things up so that if there are no forces on the
bar, it will be completely absorbed at L+. But we
now postulate that if the bar should hit the point P,
it will fracture: part of it (the part that hits L+) will be
sent back in time and the rest will continue on above
L+. So continuity of a sort is restored: now we
have not just the possibility of the whole charge being sent back or
nothing, we have the continuum degrees of charge in between.
It is not hard to see that the restoration of continuity restores
the existence of a consistent solution. If no charge is sent back
through time, then the bar is not deflected and all of it hits
L+ (and hence is sent back through time). If all
the charge is sent back through time, then is incoming bar is deflected
to an extent that it misses L+ completely, and so
no charge is sent back. But if just the right amount of charge is sent
back through time, then the bar will be only partially deflected,
deflected so that it hits the edge point P, and is split into
a bit that goes back and a bit that does not, with the bit that goes
back being just the right amount of charge to produce just that
deflection (figure 11).
Figure 11: Solution to Elga's Paradox with a Charged Bar
Our problem about conservation of momentum is also solved: piece of
the bar that does not time travel has lower momentum to the right at
the end than it had initially, but the piece that does time travel has
a higher momentum (due to the Coulomb forces), and everything balances
out.
Is it cheating to model the charged particle as a bar that can
fracture? What if we insist that the particle is truly a point
particle, and hence that its time travel is an all-or-nothing
affair?
In that case, we now have to worry about a question we have not yet
confronted: what happens if our point particle hits exactly at the
point P on the diagram? Does it time-travel or not?
Confronting this question requires us to face up to a feature of the
rather cheap way we implemented time travel in our toy models by
cut-and-paste. The way we rejiggered the space-time structure had a
rather severe consequence: the resulting space-time is no longer a
manifold: the topological structure at the point P is
different from the topological structure elsewhere. Mathematical
physicists simply don't deal with such structures: the usual procedure
is to eliminate the offending point from the space-time and thus
restore the manifold structure. In this case, that would leave a
bare singularity at point P, an open edge to
space-time into which anything could disappear and out of which, for
all the physics tells us, anything could emerge.
In particular, if we insist that our particle is a point particle,
then if its trajectory should happen to intersect P it will
simply disappear. What could cause the extremely fortuitous result that
the trajectory strikes precisely at P? The emergence of some
other charged particle, with just the right charge and trajectory,
from P (on L-). And we are no
longer bound by any conservation laws: the bare singularity can both
swallow and produce whatever mass or change or momentum we like. So if
we insist on point particles, then we have to take account of the
singularity, and that again saves the day.
Consideration of these (slightly more complicated) toy models does
not replace the proving of theorems, of course. But they do serve to
illustrate the sorts of consideration that necessarily come into play
when trying to spell out the physics of time travel in all detail. Let
us now discuss some results regarding some slightly more realistic
models that have been discussed in the physics literature.
Echeverria, Klinkhammer and Thorne (1991) considered the case of
3-dimensional single hard spherical ball that can go through a single
time travel wormhole so as to collide with its younger self.
The threat of paradox in this case arises in the following form.
There are initial trajectories (starting in the non-time travel region
of space-time) for the ball such that if such a trajectory is continued
(into the time travel region), assuming that the ball does not undergo
a collision prior to entering mouth 1 of the wormhole, it will exit
mouth 2 so as to collide with its earlier self prior to its entry into
mouth 1 in such a way as to prevent its earlier self from entering
mouth 1. Thus it seems that the ball will enter mouth 1 if and only if
it does not enter mouth 1. Of course, the Wheeler-Feynman strategy is
to look for a ‘glancing blow’ solution: a collision which
will produce exactly the (small) deviation in trajectory of the earlier
ball that produces exactly that collision. Are there always such
 solutions?[3]
Echeverria, Klinkhammer & Thorne found a large class of initial
trajectories that have consistent ‘glancing blow’
continuations, and found none that do not (but their search was not
completely general). They did not produce a rigorous proof that every
initial trajectory has a consistent continuation, but suggested that it
is very plausible that every initial trajectory has a consistent
continuation. That is to say, they have made it very plausible that, in
the billiard ball wormhole case, the time travel structure of such a
wormhole space-time does not result in constraints on states on
spacelike surfaces in the non-time travel region.
In fact, as one might expect from our discussion in the previous
section, they found the opposite problem from that of inconsistency:
they found underdetermination. For a large class of initial
trajectories there are multiple different consistent ‘glancing
blow’ continuations of that trajectory (many of which involve
multiple wormhole traversals). For example, if one initially has a ball
that is traveling on a trajectory aimed straight between the two
mouths, then one obvious solution is that the ball passes between the
two mouths and never time travels. But another solution is that the
younger ball gets knocked into mouth 1 exactly so as to come out of
mouth 2 and produce that collision. Echeverria et al. do not note the
possibility (which we pointed out in the previous section) of the
existence of additional balls in the time travel region. We conjecture
(but have no proof) that for every initial trajectory of A
there are some, and generically many, multiple ball continuations.
Friedman et al. 1990 examined the case of source free
non-self-interacting scalar fields traveling through such a time
travel wormhole and found that no constraints on initial conditions in
the non-time travel region are imposed by the existence of such time
travel wormholes. In general there appear to be no known counter
examples to the claim that in ‘somewhat realistic’
time-travel space-times with a partial Cauchy surface there are no
constraints imposed on the state on such a partial Cauchy surface by
the existence of CTC's. (See e.g., Friedman and Morris 1991, Thorne
1994, and Earman 1995; in the Other Internet Resources, see Earman,
Smeenk, and Wüthrich 2003.)
How about the issue of constraints in the time travel region
T? Prima facie, constraints in such a region would
not appear to be surprising. But one might still expect that there
should be no constraints on states on a spacelike surface, provided
one keeps the surface ‘small enough’. In the physics
literature the following question has been asked: for any point
p in T, and any space-like surface S that
includes p is there a neighborhood E of p
in S such that any solution on E can be extended to
a solution on the whole space-time? With respect to this question,
there are some simple models in which one has this kind of
extendibility of local solutions to global ones, and some simple
models in which one does not have such extendibility, with no clear
general pattern. The technical mathematical problems are amplified by the more conceptual problem of what it might mean to say that one could create a situation which forces the creation of closed timelike curves. (See e.g. Yurtsever 1990, Friedman et al. 1990,
Novikov 1992, Earman 1995 and Earman, Smeenk and Wüthrich 2009; in the Other Internet Resources, see
Earman, Smeenk and Wüthrich 2003). What are we to think of all of
this?
Since it is not obvious that one can rid oneself of all constraints
in realistic models, let us examine the argument that time travel is
implausible, and we should think it unlikely to exist in our world, in
so far as it implies such constraints. The argument goes something like
the following. In order to satisfy such constraints one needs some
pre-established divine harmony between the global (time travel)
structure of space-time and the distribution of particles and fields on
space-like surfaces in it. But it is not plausible that the actual
world, or any world even remotely like ours, is constructed with divine
harmony as part of the plan. In fact, one might argue, we have
empirical evidence that conditions in any spatial region can vary quite
arbitrarily. So we have evidence that such constraints, whatever they
are, do not in fact exist in our world. So we have evidence that there
are no closed time-like lines in our world or one remotely like it. We
will now examine this argument in more detail by presenting four
possible responses, with counterresponses, to this argument.
Response 1. There is nothing implausible or new about such
constraints. For instance, if the universe is spatially closed, there
has to be enough matter to produce the needed curvature, and this puts
constraints on the matter distribution on a space-like hypersurface.
Thus global space-time structure can quite unproblematically constrain
matter distributions on space-like hypersurfaces in it. Moreover we
have no realistic idea what these constraints look like, so we hardly
can be said to have evidence that they do not obtain.
Counterresponse 1. Of course there are constraining relations
between the global structure of space-time and the matter in it. The
Einstein equations relate curvature of the manifold to the matter
distribution in it. But what is so strange and implausible about the
constraints imposed by the existence of closed time-like curves is that
these constraints in essence have nothing to do with the Einstein
equations. When investigating such constraints one typically treats the
particles and/or field in question as test particles and/or fields in a
given space-time, i.e., they are assumed not to affect the metric of
space-time in any way. In typical space-times without closed time-like
curves this means that one has, in essence, complete freedom of matter
distribution on a space-like hypersurface. (See response 2 for some
more discussion of this issue). The constraints imposed by the
possibility of time travel have a quite different origin and are
implausible. In the ordinary case there is a causal interaction between
matter and space-time that results in relations between global
structure of space-time and the matter distribution in it. In the time
travel case there is no such causal story to be told: there simply has
to be some pre-established harmony between the global space-time
structure and the matter distribution on some space-like surfaces. This
is implausible.
Response 2. Constraints upon matter distributions are nothing new.
For instance, Maxwell's equations constrain electric fields
E on an initial surface to be related to the
(simultaneous) charge density distribution ρ by the equation ρ
= div(E). (If we assume that the E
field is generated solely by the charge distribution, this conditions
amounts to requiring that the E field at any point in space
simply be the one generated by the charge distribution according to
Coulomb's inverse square law of electrostatics.) This is not
implausible divine harmony. Such constraints can hold as a matter of
physical law. Moreover, if we had inferred from the apparent free
variation of conditions on spatial regions that there could be no such
constraints we would have mistakenly inferred that ρ =
div(E) could not be a law of nature.
Counterresponse 2. The constraints imposed by the existence of
closed time-like lines are of quite a different character from the
constraint imposed by ρ = div(E). The
constraints imposed by ρ = div(E) on the
state on a space-like hypersurface are: (i) local constraints (i.e., to
check whether the constraint holds in a region you just need to see
whether it holds at each point in the region), (ii) quite independent
of the global space-time structure, (iii) quite independent of how the
space-like surface in question is embedded in a given space-time, and
(iv) very simply and generally stateable. On the other hand, the
consistency constraints imposed by the existence of closed time-like
curves (i) are not local, (ii) are dependent on the global structure of
space-time, (iii) depend on the location of the space-like surface in
question in a given space-time, and (iv) appear not to be simply
stateable other than as the demand that the state on that space-like
surface embedded in such and such a way in a given space-time, do not
lead to inconsistency. On some views of laws (e.g., David Lewis' view)
this plausibly implies that such constraints, even if they hold, could
not possibly be laws. But even if one does not accept such a view of
laws, one could claim that the bizarre features of such constraints
imply that it is implausible that such constraints hold in our world or
in any world remotely like ours.
Response 3. It would be strange if there are constraints in the
non-time travel region. It is not strange if there are constraints in
the time travel region. They should be explained in terms of the
strange, self-interactive, character of time travel regions. In this
region there are time-like trajectories from points to themselves. Thus
the state at such a point, in such a region, will, in a sense, interact
with itself. It is a well-known fact that systems that interact with
themselves will develop into an equilibrium state, if there is such an
equilibrium state, or else will develop towards some singularity.
Normally, of course, self-interaction isn't true instantaneous
self-interaction, but consists of a feed-back mechanism that takes
time. But in time travel regions something like true instantaneous
self-interaction occurs. This explains why constraints on states occur
in such time travel regions: the states ‘ab initio’ have to
be ‘equilibrium states’. Indeed in a way this also provides
some picture of why indeterminism occurs in time travel regions: at the
onset of self-interaction states can fork into different equi-possible
equilibrium states.
Counterresponse 3. This is explanation by woolly analogy. It all
goes to show that time travel leads to such bizarre consequences that
it is unlikely that it occurs in a world remotely like ours.
Response 4. All of the previous discussion completely misses the
point. So far we have been taking the space-time structure as given,
and asked the question whether a given time travel space-time structure
imposes constraints on states on (parts of) space-like surfaces.
However, space-time and matter interact. Suppose that one is in a
space-time with closed time-like lines, such that certain
counterfactual distributions of matter on some neighborhood of a point
p are ruled out if one holds that space-time structure fixed.
One might then ask “Why does the actual state near p in
fact satisfy these constraints? By what divine luck or plan is this
local state compatible with the global space-time structure? What if
conditions near p had been slightly different?” And one might
take it that the lack of normal answers to these questions indicates
that it is very implausible that our world, or any remotely like it, is
such a time travel universe. However the proper response to these
question is the following. There are no constraints in any significant
sense. If they hold they hold as a matter of accidental fact, not of
law. There is no more explanation of them possible than there is of any
contingent fact. Had conditions in a neighborhood of p been
otherwise, the global structure of space-time would have been
different. So what? The only question relevant to the issue of
constraints is whether an arbitrary state on an arbitrary spatial
surface S can always be embedded into a space-time such that
that state on S consistently extends to a solution on the
entire space-time.
But we know the answer to that question. A well-known theorem in
general relativity says the following: any initial data set on a three
dimensional manifold S with positive definite metric has a
unique embedding into a maximal space-time in which S is a
Cauchy surface (see e.g., Geroch and Horowitz 1979, p. 284 for more
detail), i.e., there is a unique largest space-time which has
S as a Cauchy surface and contains a consistent evolution of
the initial value data on S. Now since S is a Cauchy
surface this space-time does not have closed time like curves. But it
may have extensions (in which S is not a Cauchy surface)
which include closed timelike curves, indeed it may be that any
maximal extension of it would include closed timelike curves. (This
appears to be the case for extensions of states on certain surfaces of
Taub-NUT space-times. See Earman, Smeenk, and Wüthrich 2003 in
the Other Internet Resources). But these extensions, of course, will
be consistent. So properly speaking, there are no constraints on
states on space-like surfaces. Nonetheless the space-time in which
these are embedded may or may not include closed time-like curves.
Counterresponse 4. This, in essence, is the stonewalling answer
which we indicated at the beginning of section 2. However, whether or
not you call the constraints imposed by a given space-time on
distributions of matter on certain space-like surfaces ‘genuine
constraints’, whether or not they can be considered lawlike, and
whether or not they need to be explained, the existence of such
constraints can still be used to argue that time travel worlds are so
bizarre that it is implausible that our world or any world remotely
like ours is a time travel world.
Suppose that one is in a time travel world. Suppose that given the
global space-time structure of this world, there are constraints
imposed upon, say, the state of motion of a ball on some space-like
surface when it is treated as a test particle, i.e., when it is assumed
that the ball does not affect the metric properties of the space-time
it is in. (There is lots of other matter that, via the Einstein
equation, corresponds exactly to the curvature that there is everywhere
in this time travel worlds.) Now a real ball of course does have some
effect on the metric of the space-time it is in. But let us consider a
ball that is so small that its effect on the metric is negligible.
Presumably it will still be the case that certain states of this ball
on that space-like surface are not compatible with the global time
travel structure of this universe.
This means that the actual distribution of matter on such a
space-like surface can be extended into a space-time with closed
time-like lines, but that certain counterfactual distributions of
matter on this space-like surface can not be extended into the same
space-time. But note that the changes made in the matter
distribution (when going from the actual to the counterfactual
distribution) do not in any non-negligible way affect the metric
properties of the space-time. Thus the reason why the global time
travel properties of the counterfactual space-time have to be
significantly different from the actual space-time is not that there
are problems with metric singularities or alterations in the metric
that force significant global changes when we go to the counterfactual
matter distribution. The reason that the counterfactual space-time has
to be different is that in the counterfactual world the ball's initial
state of motion starting on the space-like surface, could not
‘meet up’ in a consistent way with its earlier self (could
not be consistently extended) if we were to let the global structure of
the counterfactual space-time be the same as that of the actual
space-time. Now, it is not bizarre or implausible that there is a
counterfactual dependence of manifold structure, even of its topology,
on matter distributions on spacelike surfaces. For instance, certain
matter distributions may lead to singularities, others may not. We may
indeed in some sense have causal power over the topology of the
space-time we live in. But this power normally comes via the Einstein
equations. But it is bizarre to think that there could be a
counterfactual dependence of global space-time structure on the
arrangement of certain tiny bits of matter on some space-like surface,
where changes in that arrangement by assumption do not affect the
metric anywhere in space-time in any significant way. It is
implausible that we live in such a world, or that a world even remotely
like ours is like that.
Let us illustrate this argument in a different way by assuming that
wormhole time travel imposes constraints upon the states of people
prior to such time travel, where the people have so little mass/energy
that they have negligible effect, via the Einstein equation, on the
local metric properties of space-time. Do you think it more plausible
that we live in a world where wormhole time travel occurs but it only
occurs when people's states are such that these local states happen to
combine with time travel in such a way that nobody ever succeeds in
killing their younger self, or do you think it more plausible that we
are not in a wormhole time travel
 world?[4]
There has been a particularly clear treatment of time travel in the
context of quantum mechanics by David Deutsch (see Deutsch 1991, and
Deutsch and Lockwood 1994) in which it is claimed that quantum
mechanical considerations show that time travel never imposes any
constraints on the pre-time travel state of systems. The essence of
this account is as follows.
A quantum system starts in state S1, interacts with its
older self, after the interaction is in state S2,
time travels while developing into state S3, then
interacts with its younger self, and ends in state
S4 (see figure 13).
Deutsch assumes that the set of possible states of this system are
the mixed states, i.e., are represented by the density matrices over
the Hilbert space of that system. Deutsch then shows that for any
initial state S1, any unitary interaction between
the older and younger self, and any unitary development during time
travel, there is a consistent solution, i.e., there is at least one
pair of states S2 and S3 such
that when S1 interacts with S3
it will change to state S2 and
S2 will then develop into S3.
The states S2, S3 and
S4 will typically be not be pure states, i.e., will
be non-trivial mixed states, even if S1 is pure. In
order to understand how this leads to interpretational problems let us
give an example. Consider a system that has a two dimensional Hilbert
space with as a basis the states
 
 and
 .
 Let us suppose that when state
 
 of the young system
encounters state
 
 of the older system, they interact and the young
system develops into state
 
 and the old system remains in state
 .
 In obvious
notation:
Similarly, suppose that:
13 develops into
 24,
and
13 develops into
 24.
Let us furthermore assume that there is no development of the state
of the system during time travel, i.e., that
 2
develops into
 3, and that
 2
develops into
 3.
Now, if the only possible states of the system were
 
 and
 
 (i.e., if there
were no superpositions or mixtures of these states), then there is a
constraint on initial states: initial state
 1 is
impossible. For if
 1 interacts with
 3 then it
will develop into
 2, which, during time travel, will develop
into
 3, which inconsistent with the assumed
state
 3. Similarly if
 1
interacts with
 3 it will develop into
 2, which
will then develop into
 3 which is also inconsistent. Thus the
system can not start in state
 1.
But, says Deutsch, in quantum mechanics such a system can also be in
any mixture of the states
 
 and
 .
 Suppose that the older system, prior to the
interaction, is in a state S3 which is an equal
mixture of 50%
 3 and 50%
 3. Then
the younger system during the interaction will develop into a mixture
of 50%
 2 and 50%
 2, which
will then develop into a mixture of 50%
 3 and
 50%
 3,
which is consistent! More generally Deutsch uses a fixed point theorem
to show that no matter what the unitary development during interaction
is, and no matter what the unitary development during time travel is,
for any state S1 there is always a state
S3 (which typically is not a pure state) which
causes S1 to develop into a state
S2 which develops into that state
S3. Thus quantum mechanics comes to the rescue: it
shows in all generality that no constraints on initial states are
needed!
One might wonder why Deutsch appeals to mixed states: will
superpositions of states
 
 and
 
 not suffice? Unfortunately such an idea does not
work. Suppose again that the initial state is
 1. One
might suggest that that if state S3 is
 1/√2 3
 +
 1/√2 3 one
will obtain a consistent development. For one might think that when
initial state
 1 encounters the superposition
 1/√2 3
 +
 1/√2 3, it
will develop into superposition
 1/√2 2
 +
 1/√2 2, and
that this in turn will develop into
 1/√2 3
 +
 1/√2 3, as
desired. However this is not correct. For initial state
 1 when it
encounters
 1/√2 3 +
 1/√2 3, will
develop into the entangled state
 1/√2 24
 +
 1/√2 24. In so
far as one can speak of the state of the young system after this
interaction, it is in the mixture of 50%
 2 and
 50%
 2,
not in the superposition
 1/√2 2 +
 1/√2 2. So
Deutsch does need his recourse to mixed states.
This clarification of why Deutsch needs his mixtures does however
indicate a serious worry about the simplifications that are part of
Deutsch's account. After the interaction the old and young system will
(typically) be in an entangled state. Although for purposes of a
measurement on one of the two systems one can say that this system is
in a mixed state, one can not represent the full state of the two
systems by specifying the mixed state of each separate part, as there
are correlations between observables of the two systems that are not
represented by these two mixed states, but are represented in the
joint entangled state. But if there really is an entangled state of
the old and young systems directly after the interaction, how is one
to represent the subsequent development of this entangled state? Will
the state of the younger system remain entangled with the state of the
older system as the younger system time travels and the older system
moves on into the future? On what space-like surfaces are we to
imagine this total entangled state to be? At this point it becomes
clear that there is no obvious and simple way to extend elementary
non-relativistic quantum mechanics to space-times with closed
time-like curves. There have been more sophisticated approaches than
Deutsch's to time travel, using technical machinery from quantum field
theory and differentiable manifolds (see e.g., Friedman et al 1991,
Earman, Smeenk, and Wüthrich 2003 in the Other Internet Resources,
and references therein). But out of such approaches no results
anywhere near as clear and interesting as Deutsch's have been
forthcoming.
How does Deutsch avoid these complications? Deutsch assumes a mixed
state S3 of the older system prior to the
interaction with the younger system. He lets it interact with an
arbitrary pure state S1 younger system. After this
interaction there is an entangled state S′ of the two
systems. Deutsch computes the mixed state S2 of the
younger system which is implied by this entangled state
S′. His demand for consistency then is just that this
mixed state S2 develops into the mixed state
S3. Now it is not at all clear that this is a
legitimate way to simplify the problem of time travel in quantum
mechanics. But even if we grant him this simplification there is a
problem: how are we to understand these mixtures?
If we take an ignorance interpretation of mixtures we run into
trouble. For suppose that we assume that in each individual case each
older system is either in state
 3 or in state
 3 prior
to the interaction. Then we regain our paradox. Deutsch instead
recommends the following, many worlds, picture of mixtures. Suppose we
start with state
 1 in all worlds. In some of the many worlds
the older system will be in the
 3 state, let us call them
A-worlds, and in some worlds, B-worlds, it will be in
the
 3 state. Thus in A-worlds after
interaction we will have state
 2 , and in B-worlds we will have
state
 2. During time travel the
 2 state
will remain the same, i.e., turn into state
 3, but
the systems in question will travel from A-worlds to
B-worlds. Similarly the
 2 states will travel from the
B-worlds to the A-worlds, thus preserving
consistency.
Now whatever one thinks of the merits of many worlds
interpretations, and of this understanding of it applied to mixtures,
in the end one does not obtain genuine time travel in Deutsch's
account. The systems in question travel from one time in one world to
another time in another world, but no system travels to an earlier time
in the same world. (This is so at least in the normal sense of the word
‘world,’ the sense that one means when, for instance, one
says “there was, and will be, only one Elvis Presley in this
world.”) Thus, even if it were a reasonable view, it is not quite as
interesting as it may have initially seemed.
What remains of the killing-your-earlier-self paradox in general
relativistic time travel worlds is the fact that in some cases the
states on edgeless spacelike surfaces are
‘overconstrained’, so that one has less than the usual
freedom in specifying conditions on such a surface, given the
time-travel structure, and in some cases such states are
‘underconstrained’, so that states on edgeless space-like
surfaces do not determine what happens elsewhere in the way that they
usually do, given the time travel structure. There can also be mixtures
of those two types of cases. The extent to which states are
overconstrained and/or underconstrained in realistic models is as yet
unclear, though it would be very surprising if neither obtained. The
extant literature has primarily focused on the problem of
overconstraint, since that, often, either is regarded as a metaphysical
obstacle to the possibility time travel, or as an epistemological
obstacle to the plausibility of time travel in our world. While it is
true that our world would be quite different from the way we normally
think it is if states were overconstrained, underconstraint seems at
least as bizarre as overconstraint. Nonetheless, neither directly rules
out the possibility of time travel.
If time travel entailed contradictions then the issue would be
settled. And indeed, most of the stories employing time travel in
popular culture are logically incoherent: one cannot “change”
the past to be different from what it was, since the past (like the
present and the future) only occurs once. But if the only requirement
demanded is logical coherence, then it seems all too easy. A clever
author can devise a coherent time-travel scenario in which everything
happens just once and in a consistent way. This is just too cheap:
logical coherence is a very weak condition, and many things we take to
be metaphysically impossible are logically coherent. For example, it
involves no logical contradiction to suppose that water is not
molecular, but if both chemistry and Kripke are right it is a
metaphysical impossibility. We have been interested not in logical
possibility but in physical possibility. But even so, our conditions
have been relatively weak: we have asked only whether time-travel is
consistent with the universal validity of certain fundamental physical
laws and with the notion that the physical state on a surface prior to
the time travel region be unconstrained. It is perfectly possible that
the physical laws obey this condition, but still that time travel is
not metaphysically possible because of the nature of time itself.
Consider an analogy. Aristotle believed that water is homoiomerous and
infinitely divisible: any bit of water could be subdivided, in
principle, into smaller bits of water. Aristotle's view contains no
logical contradiction. It was certainly consistent with Aristotle's
conception of water that it be homoiomerous, so this was, for him, a
conceptual possibility. But if chemistry is right, Aristotle was wrong
both about what water is like and what is possible for it. It can't be
infinitely divided, even though no logical or conceptual analysis would
reveal that.
Similarly, even if all of our consistency conditions can be met, it
does not follow that time travel is physically possible, only that some
specific physical considerations cannot rule it out. The only serious
proof of the possibility of time travel would be a demonstration of its
actuality. For if we agree that there is no actual time travel in our
universe, the supposition that there might have been involves
postulating a substantial difference from actuality, a difference
unlike in kind from anything we could know if firsthand. It is unclear
to us exactly what the content of possible would be if one were to
either maintain or deny the possibility of time travel in these
circumstances, unless one merely meant that the possibility is not
ruled out by some delineated set of constraints. As the example of
Aristotle's theory of water shows, conceptual and logical
“possibility” do not entail possibility in a full-blooded
sense. What exactly such a full-blooded sense would be in case of time
travel, and whether one could have reason to believe it to obtain,
remain to us obscure.
