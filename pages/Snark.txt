Snarks are a species of bandersnatch and are thought to have evolved
from the slithy toves along with the other bandersnatches. Snarks
evolved in the Devonian period and successfully adapted themselves in
several ecological niches until the late 19th century. The fact that
they have a dorsal sigmoid bone establishes their descent from the
slithy toves.
Snarks bear young just at the point in early summer when their food
source is most abundant. Their biological clocks are very well tuned
and biologists study them as the principal model of such clocks in the
animal kingdom.
There is nothing like the wonder and pageantry of snarks in mating
season, as they gyre and gimble on the ponds of New England forests.
