R.G. Collingwood (1939) was an early advocate of taking questions
seriously. In the decades since the publication of Collingwood’s
autobiography the topic of questions has regularly received attention
from linguists, logicians, and philosophers of language, but few have
joined Collingwood (1939, 36–37) in suggesting that
propositional logic be replaced by a logic of question and answer in
which neither question nor proposition is more basic. Instead, most
work on questions since the Second World War fits squarely within the
Fregean paradigm where propositions, declarative sentences, and
assertion have primacy. The primacy of the assertoric is evident in
the work of many who write on the semantics of what Belnap and Steel
(1976) call elementary questions and who regard any such question as
being identifiable with a set or function involving the propositions
that are the question’s answers.
Familiar considerations from the philosophy of language make it clear
that one should distinguish interrogative sentences from their
contents and distinguish both of these from the speech acts that can
be performed via the utterance of interrogative sentences. For
example, Belnap and Steel (1976, 3) understand a question to be an
abstract thing for which an interrogative sentence is a piece of
notation. This parallels the distinction between propositions and the
declarative sentences that express them. The structure and composition
of a question (understood as the abstract content of an interrogative
sentence) vary from theory to theory. The speech act of asking a
question is standardly regarded, e.g., by Searle (1969, 69), as a
special case of the illocutionary act of requesting. Searle
distinguishes requesting information (asking a real question) from
requesting that the hearer display knowledge (asking an exam
question). Åqvist (1965) connects questions with speaker
knowledge rather than hearer knowledge by proposing that to ask a
question is to command the hearer to cause the speaker to know the
question’s answer.
As is already clear, an important concept in the theory of questions
is that of an answer, sometimes called a direct answer.
Theorists generally agree that an answer is a piece of language or
semantic object that, as Belnap and Steel (1976, 3) put it,
“completely, but just completely, answers the question.” A
sentence or proposition need not be true to be a direct answer.
Whether each question can be associated with a definite set of direct
answers is a controversial matter, however. Most authors require
answers to be sentences or propositions, so that answers to a question
are the kind of thing that is true or false. Tichy (1978) is a
striking exception and argues that answers can be of any logical type.
Consider this example:
Most theorists would say that (1a) is the correct answer to (1), that
(1b) is an answer but not the correct answer, and that (1c–e)
are not answers to (1) at all. Tichy would say that, among
(1a–e), only (1c–d) are answers, and (1c) is the correct
answer. Braun (2006) would count (1a–b) as answers and include
(1e) as both an answer and a correct answer.
A second important basic concept connected with questions is that of a
presupposition. Belnap and Steel (1976, 5) define a question
as presupposing a statement if and only if the truth of the statement
is a logically necessary condition for there being a true (i.e.,
correct) answer to the question. For example, (1a) presupposes the
following:
To deny a presupposition of a question is to give a corrective
answer to the question, but most theorists join Belnap and Steel
in not counting corrective answers as direct answers.
Several kinds of questions have been distinguished in the
literature.
Whether-questions are questions like ‘Was there a
quorum at the meeting?’ and ‘Does Jones live in Italy, in
Spain, or in Germany?’. These examples illustrate that
whether-questions come in two varieties: a whether-question may be of
the yes-or-no variety, or it may present two or more alternative
direct answers other than yes and no. In either case, a
whether-question explicitly presents a finite number of direct
answers. Consider the first example:
The answers to (3) are (3a–b), and (3) presupposes that the
meeting occurred. Thus (4) is a corrective answer to (3):
Question (5) is ambiguous:
Question (5) can be read as a yes-no question having two direct
answers, but it also has a reading on which it presents exactly three
direct answers, namely (5a–c). On the latter reading, (5)
presupposes that Jones lives in Italy, in Spain, or in Germany; thus
(6) is a corrective answer to (5):
Which-questions are questions like ‘What is the
smallest prime number greater than 12?’, ‘Which cardinal
was elected Pope in 2013?’, and ‘Who shot J.R.?’
Unlike a whether-question, a which-question may have an indefinite or
infinite number of direct answers.
Belnap and Steel (1976) refer to whether- and which-questions as
elementary questions. We consider these kinds of questions in
detail in section 2.
Another major category of questions are why-questions. It has
long been recognized that why-questions are intimately linked with the
concept of explanation. For example, Hempel and Oppenheim (1948, 334)
write as follows:
We consider why-questions in detail in section 3.
Yet another major category of questions are embedded or
indirect questions, which occur as wh-complements in
declarative sentences:
The issue of how to understand embedded questions lies at the
intersection of the philosophy of language and epistemology and will
be treated in section 4.
This section provides an overview of some of the most prominent
treatments of elementary questions at the intersection of philosophy
of language and formal semantics.
A common starting point for many formal semantic treatments of
questions is the idea that “questions set up a choice-situation
between a set of propositions, namely those propositions that count as
answers to it” (Hamblin 1973, 48). One way to implement this
idea is to take a question to denote, in a world \(w\), the set of
propositions that correspond to a possible answer to the question
(Hamblin 1973). Another way to implement the same idea is to let a
question denote, in a world \(w\), the set of propositions that
correspond to its true answers in \(w\) (Karttunen 1977).
In both systems, the meaning of a question is a function from
worlds to sets of propositions. In Hamblin’s system, this
function maps every possible world to the same set of propositions,
corresponding to the set of all possible answers; in Karttunen’s
system, every world is mapped to a subset of all possible answers,
namely those that are true in the given world. As acknowledged by
Karttunen (1977, 10), the difference is inessential. In both cases,
the meaning of a question is fully determined by—and could be
identified with—the set of all propositions that correspond to a
possible answer.
A fundamental problem with these accounts is that they do not specify
in more detail what “possible answers” are supposed to be.
Of course, they do provide a compositional semantics for a fragment of
English, and thereby specify what they take to be the possible answers
to the questions in that fragment. But in order for these theories to
be evaluated, we first need to know what the notion of a
“possible answer” is intended to capture. To illustrate
this point, consider the following example:
In principle, all the responses in (8a–d) could be seen as
possible answers to (8). For Hamblin and Karttunen, only (8a) counts
as such. However, it is not clear what the precise criteria are for
being considered a possible answer, and on which grounds (8a) is to be
distinguished from (8b–d).
Groenendijk and Stokhof (1984) take a question to denote, in each
world, a single proposition embodying the true exhaustive
answer to the question in that world. For instance, if \(w\) is a
world in which Paul and Nina are coming for dinner, and nobody else is
coming, then the denotation of (8) in \(w\) is the proposition
expressed by (8b).
The meaning of a question, then, is a function from worlds to
propositions. These propositions have two special properties: they are
mutually exclusive (since two different exhaustive answers
are always incompatible), and together they form a cover of
the entire logical space (since every world is compatible with at
least one exhaustive answer). So the meaning of a question can be
identified with a set of propositions which form a partition
of the logical space.
In many cases, it is intuitively clear what the “true exhaustive
answer” to a question in a given world is, at least much clearer
than what all the “possible answers” to that question are.
This means that a partition semantics can in many cases be tested
against clear intuitions, unlike a Hamblin semantics.
However, in some cases it is not so clear what the “true
exhaustive answer” to a question in a given world is. Consider
the following examples (in (10) we use \(\uparrow\) and \(\downarrow\) to indicate
rising and falling intonation, respectively):
What is the true exhaustive answer to (9) in a world where Ann is
coming and Bill is coming as well? One option is the proposition
\(\{w\): Ann and Bill are both coming in \(w\}\), but another
option is the proposition \(\{w\): if Ann is coming in \(w\) then
Bill is also coming in \(w\}\). It is not quite clear
pre-theoretically which of these two options is more suitable. Notice
that if we pick the second option, then we must assume that the true
exhaustive answer to (9) in a world where Ann is coming but Bill is
not coming is \(\{w\): if Ann is coming in \(w\) then Bill is not
coming in \(w\}\). And this would mean that these two
‘exhaustive’ answers actually overlap (they both contain
all worlds where Ann is not coming) and thus do not form a partition.
This may be considered a reason to pick the first option instead.
However, this line of reasoning is purely theory-internal; it seems
impossible to decide on theory-external grounds what the true
exhaustive answers to a conditional question should be taken to be.
Conditional questions like (9) also present another challenge for a
partition semantics, concerning answers that deny the antecedent of
the conditional (in this case the answer that Ann is not coming).
Intuitively, such answers dispel the issue raised by the question, but
do not resolve the issue as intended. Their status differs from
answers that do resolve the issue as intended (in this case the answer
that Bill is coming if Ann is coming, and the answer that Bill is not
coming if Ann is coming). In a basic partition semantics it is
impossible to capture this. In worlds where Ann is not coming, the
answer that Ann is not coming presumably is the true exhaustive
answer. Its special status, however, cannot be captured.
A similar problem arises with alternative questions like (10). In this
case, the answer that neither Ann nor Bill is coming and the answer
that Ann and Bill are both coming have a different status than the
answer that only Ann is coming and the answer that only Bill is
coming. Again, this difference in status cannot be captured in a
simple partition semantics.
We now turn our attention to a line of work that aims to capture the
semantics of questions in a dynamic framework. The first
theories in this line of work were developed by Jäger (1996),
Hulstijn (1997), and Groenendijk (1999). Aloni et al. (2007b)
contains a collection of papers elaborating on these early proposals.
All these theories essentially reformulate the partition theory of
questions in the format of an update semantics (Veltman 1996). This
means that they explicitly identify meanings with context change
potentials, i.e., functions over discourse contexts. However,
unlike a simple update semantics where discourse contexts are modeled
as sets of worlds—embodying the information established in the
discourse so far—these theories provide a more refined model of
discourse contexts, one that also embodies the issues that have been
raised so far. More specifically, a discourse context is modeled as an
equivalence relation \(R\) over a set of worlds \(C\).
The set of worlds \(C\), i.e., the domain of \(R\), can be
thought of as the context set, i.e., the set of all worlds
that are compatible with the information established in the discourse
so far. \(R\) itself induces a partition on \(C\), and can thus
be taken to encode the issues that have been raised so far. More
specifically, we can think of \(R\) as relating two worlds \(w\)
and \(v\) just in case the difference between \(w\) and \(v\)
is not (yet) at issue, i.e., the discourse participants have not yet
expressed an interest in information that would distinguish between
\(w\) and \(v\). In other words, \(R\) can be conceived of as
a relation encoding indifference (Hulstijn 1997).
Both assertions and questions can then be taken to have the potential
to change the context in which they are uttered. Assertions restrict
the context set \(C\) to those worlds in which the asserted
sentence is true (strictly speaking, they remove all pairs of worlds
\(\langle w,v\rangle\) from \(R\) such that the asserted
sentence is false in at least one of the two worlds). Questions
disconnect worlds, i.e., they remove a pair
\(\langle w,v\rangle\) from \(R\) just in case the true
exhaustive answer to the question in \(w\) differs from the true
exhaustive answer to the question in \(v\).
Thus, the dynamic framework of Jäger (1996), Hulstijn (1997), and
Groenendijk (1999) provides a notion of context and meaning that
embodies both informative and inquisitive content in a uniform way.
However, the framework inherits several issues from the classical
partition theory of questions, in particular those discussed above
concerning conditional and alternative questions.
Moreover, there is a conceptual issue concerning the equivalence
relation \(R\). Namely, if \(R\) is primarily thought of as a
relation encoding indifference, then it is not clear why it
should always be an equivalence relation. In particular, it
is not clear why \(R\) should always be transitive. The
discourse participants could very well be interested in information
that distinguishes \(w\) from \(v\), while they are not
interested in information that distinguishes either \(w\) or
\(v\) from a third world \(u\). To model such a situation, we
would need an indifference relation \(R\) such that
\(\langle w,u\rangle \in R\) and
\(\langle u,v\rangle \in R\) but
\(\langle w,v\rangle \not\in R\). This is impossible if we
require \(R\) to be transitive.
These concerns have been addressed by Groenendijk (2009) and
Mascarenhas (2009). The overall architecture of their system is very
much like that of the early dynamic systems discussed above, only
indifference relations are no longer defined as equivalence relations,
but rather as reflexive and symmetric (not necessarily transitive)
relations.
Groenendijk and Mascarenhas argued that this adjustment, besides
addressing the conceptual issue concerning indifference relations
discussed above, also allows for a better analysis of conditional
questions and alternative questions. However, Ciardelli (2009) and
Ciardelli and Roelofsen (2011) show that, although the proposed system
indeed behaves better for simple cases, it does not scale up to more
complex cases in a suitable way. In particular, whereas alternative
questions with two disjuncts, like (10) above, are dealt with
satisfactorily, or at least more satisfactorily than in a partition
semantics, alternative questions with three or more disjuncts are
still problematic.
The gist of the problem can be illustrated with a simple example.
Consider a language with three atomic sentences, \(p, q\),
and \(r\), and an information state consisting of three worlds,
\(w_{pq}, w_{qr}\), and
\(w_{pr}\), where the subscripts of each world
indicate which atomic sentences are true at that world. Note that in
this information state none of the atomic sentences is known to hold.
Now consider an issue which is resolved just in case at least one of
the atomic sentences is established, i.e., just in case we know that
the actual world is located within one of the ovals depicted in figure
1.
Figure 1: An issue that cannot be
represented in the pair-semantics.
The problem with the system of Groenendijk (2009) and Mascarenhas
(2009) is manifested by the fact that this issue cannot be represented
by means of an indifference relation. An indifference relation over
the information state
\(\{w_{pq},w_{qr},w_{pr}\}\)
necessarily contains all reflexive world-pairs, and possibly one, two,
or three non-reflexive pairs. In either case, however, the resulting
issue does not correspond to the one depicted in Figure 1.
The general conclusion that has been drawn from this problem, as
discussed in detail by Ciardelli and Roelofsen (2011), is that
question meanings cannot be suitably modeled in terms of indifference
relations, even if these indifference relations are allowed to be
non-transitive. This insight has led to the development of an
alternative logical notion of question meanings, which forms the
cornerstone of the framework of inquisitive semantics, to be
discussed below.
Recall from section 2.1.1 that a fundamental problem with the
classical semantic theories of Hamblin (1973) and Karttunen (1977) is
that they do not specify clear criteria for when a response should
count as a “possible answer”. Partition semantics
(Groenendijk and Stokhof 1984) does specify explicitly which responses
should count as possible answers, namely only those that are true and
exhaustive. In many cases, it is clear what the true and exhaustive
responses to a given question are. However, this is not always the
case, as witnessed by conditional and alternative questions. A natural
way to proceed, then, is to consider another criterion for what should
count as a possible answer.
One natural criterion is the following. We could say that a response
to a question counts as a proper answer just in case it
resolves the issue that the question raises. If we adopt this
criterion then we also have to impose a certain condition on
question-meanings. That is, question-meanings cannot just be defined
as arbitrary sets of propositions, as in the theories of Hamblin
(1973) and Karttunen (1977). Rather, they should be defined as
downward closed sets of propositions. That is, if a question
meaning contains a certain proposition \(\alpha\), then it must also
contain all stronger propositions \(\beta \subseteq \alpha\). After all,
suppose that \(\alpha\) is an element of the meaning of a question
\(Q\). Given our answerhood criterion, this means that \(\alpha\)
corresponds to an issue-resolving response to \(Q\). But then every
\(\beta \subseteq \alpha\) corresponds to an even more informative, and
therefore also issue-resolving response. So, given our answerhood
criterion, \(\beta\) must also be an element of the meaning of
\(Q\).
This conception of question meanings forms the cornerstone of the most
basic implementation of inquisitive semantics, the system
\(\Inq_B\) (Groenendijk and Roelofsen 2009, Ciardelli 2009, Ciardelli
and Roelofsen 2011, Roelofsen 2013, Ciardelli et al. 2013,
Ciardelli 2016). In this system, question meanings are defined as
downward closed sets of propositions that together cover the entire
logical space.[1]
We will refer to such sets as inquisitive question
meanings.[2]
Partitions correspond to a specific kind of inquisitive question
meanings. That is, for every partition \(\rP\), there is a corresponding
inquisitive question meaning \(I_{\rP}\), consisting
of all propositions that are contained in one of the blocks in \(\rP\):
\(I_{\rP} : = \{\alpha \subseteq \beta \mid \beta \in \rP\}\)
However, not every inquisitive question meaning corresponds to a
partition. In fact, an inquisitive question meaning \(I\)
corresponds to a partition if and only if for every subset
\(I'\subseteq I\) such that \(\cap I'\ne \varnothing\),
\(\cup I'\) is also in \(I\). There are many inquisitive
question meanings that do not have this special property. Thus, the
notion of question meanings in \(\Inq_B\)
is more general than the
notion of question meanings in partition semantics. The interested
reader is referred to Ciardelli et al. (2015) for a
discussion of several systems that fall between \(\Inq_B\)
and
partition semantics in terms of expressive power.
The set of all meanings in \(\Inq_B\),
together with a suitable
notion of entailment, form a Heyting algebra, just like the set of all
meanings in classical logic ordered by classical entailment (Roelofsen
2013). Thus, the basic connectives (disjunction, conjunction,
implication, and negation) can be associated with the basic algebraic
operations on meanings (join, meet, and (relative)
pseudo-complementation), just as in classical logic. This is indeed
how the connectives are treated in \(\Inq_B\),
although other treatments
of the connectives are also conceivable in this setting (see, e.g.,
Ciardelli et al. 2015).
In recent work, the basic system sketched above has been extended in
several directions. Below are pointers to some of these
extensions.
Ciardelli et al. (2012) consider a notion of meaning that is
very much like the one adopted in \(\Inq_B\),
but also has a
presuppositional component. Such a notion of meaning is
needed to suitably deal with alternative questions and
which-questions.
Ciardelli et al. (2017) develop a type-theoretic inquisitive
semantics, which is needed for a compositional semantic analysis of
questions.
Roelofsen and Farkas (2015) develop an inquisitive semantics in which
the meaning of a question does not only capture what is needed to
resolve the issue raised by that question, but also which propositions
are made available by the question for subsequent anaphoric reference.
These propositions may serve as antecedents for polarity particles
(e.g. Is Paul coming? Yes/No ) and other anaphoric
expressions (e.g. Is Paul coming? Then/otherwise I’ll make
pasta ).
Farkas and Roelofsen (2017) integrate inquisitive semantics with a
commitment-based model of discourse, in order to capture the special
discourse effects of non-canonical types of questions, such as
tag-questions (Paul is coming, isn’t he? ) and
declarative questions (Paul is coming? ).
Finally, Ciardelli and Roelofsen (2015), Ciardelli (2016), and van
Gessel (2016) develop a system that integrates inquisitive semantics
with dynamic epistemic logic (van Ditmarsch et al.
2007), in order to formally model the information states and
inquisitive states of the participants of a discourse, and how these
states change when a question is asked or a statement is made. It also
provides a semantics for question-embedding predicates like
‘know’ and ‘wonder’ (see also section 4).
The theories discussed above all construe question meanings as sets of
propositions, and are therefore referred to as proposition
set theories. It has been argued that question meanings as
construed by proposition set theories are all too coarse-grained to
account for certain linguistic phenomena. In order to address this
issue, several theories have been developed that adopt more
fine-grained, structured notions of question meanings. Such
theories have been couched in different semantic frameworks, which are
all more fine-grained than the standard possible world framework. For
instance, the proposal of Krifka (2001) is couched in a structured
meanings framework, that of Ginzburg and Sag (2000) in situation
semantics, that of Ginzburg (2005), Cooper and Ginzburg (2012) in type
theory with records, that of Aloni et al. (2007a) in dynamic
semantics, and that of Blutner (2012) in ortho-algebraic semantics. We
will illustrate the general approach here by focusing on the proposal
of Krifka (2001), which in turn has its roots in earlier work of Hull
(1975), Tichy (1978), Hausser (1978), von Stechow and Zimmermann
(1984), von Stechow (1991), and Ginzburg (1992).
The central idea is that question meanings are pairs
\(\langle B,R\rangle\), where \(B\) is called the
background and \(R\) the restriction. \(B\) is
a function that, when applied to the semantic value of an appropriate
term answer to the question, yields a proposition. \(R\) specifies
what appropriate term answers are, i.e., what the semantic entities
are that \(B\) can be applied to.
For instance, the meaning assigned to (11a) is
 (11b):[3]
In this case, \(B\) is a function that maps every individual
\(x\) to the proposition \(\{w: x\) called in \(w\}\),
and \(R\) is the set of students. In the case of a polar question,
\(R\) is taken to be a set consisting of two functions on
propositions, the identity function and the function that maps every
proposition to its complement, which are assumed to be expressed by
yes and no, respectively. For instance:
From a structured question meaning it is always possible to obtain the
corresponding proposition set meaning, by applying \(B\) to all the
elements of \(R\) (and taking the downward closure of the resulting
set of propositions in case we want an inquisitive question meaning in
the sense of \(\Inq_B\).
It is not possible to go in
the other direction, which means that structured question meanings
have strictly more expressive power than proposition set meanings
(e.g., von Stechow 1991, Krifka 2001). 
This additional expressive power is needed to account for certain
phenomena. For instance, the questions in (13) and (14) have exactly
the same set of exhaustive/resolving answers, which means that they
receive exactly the same semantic value in any of the proposition set
accounts discussed above.
Yet, the two questions differ in that the first licenses polarity
particle responses while the second doesn’t. In a
structured-meanings approach, the two questions are semantically
distinguishable. This additional semantic fine-grainedness forms the
basis for an account of polarity particle responses.
Note that some of the extended implementations of inquisitive
semantics (e.g., Roelofsen and Farkas 2015) are also fine-grained
enough to account for polarity particle responses. As mentioned above,
in these implementations the meaning of a question does not only
capture what is needed to resolve the issue that the question raises,
but also which propositions are made available by the question for
subsequent anaphoric reference, for instance by polarity particles. In
effect, capturing anaphoric potential also adds structure to question
meanings. Thus, these implementations maintain a proposition set
perspective, but at the same time address the need for richer semantic
structures as well. Such a synthesis is also achieved in Aloni et
al. (2007a).
The overview provided here of semantic theories of elementary
questions is of course not exhaustive. There are a number of excellent
recent handbook articles, each focusing on different aspects.
Groenendijk and Stokhof (1997) provide a thorough review of the
literature up to 1997, focusing on the partition theory, but also
supplying an in-depth discussion of the epistemic-imperative approach
(Åqvist 1965, Hintikka 1976, Hintikka 1983) and the treatment of
questions in speech act theory (Searle 1969, Vanderveeken 1990).
Ginzburg (2010) provides a concise overview of several more recent
analyses of questions, including, besides the ones discussed here, the
inferential erotetic logic of Wisniewski (2001), the
treatment of questions in modal logic by Nelken and Francez (2002) and
Nelken and Shan (2006), the dialogue-based approach of Ginzburg
(1996), Ginzburg (2012), Roberts (1996), Larsson (2002), among others,
the SDRT based approach of Asher and Lascarides (1998), and the
treatment of questions in dynamic epistemic logic developed
by van Benthem and Minică (2012). For comparison of the latter
approach with inquisitive semantics, see Ciardelli and Roelofsen
(2015) and Ciardelli (2016).
Finally, Krifka (2011) provides an overview of the classical
proposition set accounts, early implementations of inquisitive
semantics, and the structured meanings approach, taking a more
linguistic perspective than other overview articles. Krifka does not
only discuss the semantics of questions, but also their possible
syntactic configurations and intonation patterns, supplying examples
from a wide range of languages.
For whether-questions (indeed, for all elementary questions in the
view of some), the question-answer relationship can be defined in
purely formal terms. One approach to why-questions is to try to make
the question-answer relationship formal in that case, too, or at least
as formal as possible. The main proponent of this approach is
Bromberger (1966), whose account is also the first influential account
of why-questions. Van Fraassen (1980) takes an opposite view,
theorizing that the question-answer relationship is almost purely
pragmatic. We consider both theories in some detail below.
If we follow Hempel in regarding an explanation as an answer to a
why-question, Bromberger’s theory of why-questions can be seen
also as a theory of explanation, indeed, one that incorporates
Hempel’s deductive-nomological model while aiming to improve on
it.
Bromberger introduces several concepts for use in his account: the
presupposition of a why-question, abnormic laws and
their antonymic predicates, and general rules,
focusing especially on general rules that are completed by
abnormic laws.
Bromberger supposes that (15) is the general form of a
why-question:
The presupposition of (15) is \(p\), and this agrees with the usual
concept of presupposition for questions, since if \(p\) is not the
case then (15) has no correct answer. A general rule is a
(true or false) law-like statement of the form:
where \(Fx\) and \(Gx\) may, in the general case, be
conjunctions. A special abnormic law is a true, law-like
statement of the form:
Special abnormic laws satisfy five additional conditions of
non-triviality and non-redundancy that we need not get into, and
Bromberger (1966, 98) introduces the more complicated notion of a
general abnormic law, which we may also ignore for present purposes.
The predicate \(E\) appearing in a special abnormic law and
\(E\)’s negation are the antonymic predicates of the
abnormic law. Bromberger (1966, 98) illustrates the concept of an
abnormic law with the following example:
The antonymic predicates of this special abnormic law are
‘expands’ and ‘does not expand’, and the
logical form that Bromberger’s theory postulates for this
abnormic law is as
 follows:[4]
Bromberger (1966, 99) defines the completion of a general rule by an
abnormic law as follows:
Abnormic law (16) is the completion of the (false) general rule
‘No gas expands’:
Bromberger (1966, 100) goes on to define the correct answer to a why
question as follows: \(q\) is the correct answer to (15) if and
only if (i) there is an abnormic law \(L\) (which may be general or
special) and \(p\) is the proposition that results from predicating
of some individual one of the antonymic predicates of \(L\); and
(ii) \(q\) together with \(L\) and other premises
\(r_1 ,\ldots ,r_j\) constitute a
deductive-nomological explanation with conclusion \(p\); and (iii)
there is a false proposition \(s\) such that \(s\) and \(p\)
are contraries and, were it not for the falsity of \(s\) and
\(L\), premises
\(r_1 ,\ldots ,r_j\) and the
general rule completed by \(L\) would count as a
deductive-nomological explanation of \(s\); and (iv) the general
rule completed by \(L\) is such that if one of the conjuncts of its
antecedent is removed, the resulting general rule cannot be completed
by an abnormic law.
Here is an illustration of Bromberger’s theory based on abnormic
law (16). Suppose \(a\) is a sample of gas that expanded, and
suppose its pressure was kept constant but its temperature increased,
i.e., \(Ga\), \(Ea\), and \(Pa\) are all true. Now consider
the question:
On Bromberger’s theory, the correct answer is \(Pa\), i.e.,
This is the correct answer because \(Pa\), along with \(Ga\) and
abnormic law (16) form the premises of a deductive-nomological
explanation with conclusion \(Ea\), but when \(Pa\) is deleted
as a premise (leaving \(Ga\) as a premise) and general rule (17) is
substituted for abnormic law (16) as a premise, we obtain argument
(20), which would count as a deductive-nomological explanation of
\(\neg Ea\), were it not for the fact that (17) and
\(\neg Ea\) are not true: 
So, in this application of Bromberger’s theory, \(p\) is
\(Ea\), \(q\) is \(Pa\), \(L\) is (16), the general rule
completed by \(L\) is (17), \(r_1\) is \(Ga\), and
\(s\) is \(\neg Ea\).
Intuitively, Bromberger’s account makes \(Pa\) the correct
answer to (18) in virtue of the idea that \(Pa\) is a full
specification of the special (or “abnormal”) circumstances
triggering the expansion of \(a\). Notice that one of the premises
of the deductive-nomological explanation of \(Ea\), namely
\(Ga\), is not part of the triggering package and is not part of
the correct answer to (18). Two factors in Bromberger’s account
jointly keep \(Ga\) from being included. The first is that
\(Ga\) is a premise not only in the actual deductive-nomological
explanation of \(Ea\) but also in the fictitious
deductive-nomological explanation (20) of \(\neg Ea\). So
relative to (16) and (17), \(Ga\) is not a special or abnormal
circumstance. Is there another abnormic law/general rule pair relative
to which \(Ga\) would be included in the correct answer to (18)?
Apparently not, which brings us to the second factor excluding
\(Ga\) from the correct answer to (18): if \(Gx\) is dropped
from (17) we obtain the general rule ‘Nothing expands’,
which it seems that no abnormic law
 completes.[5].
Bromberger’s theory was aimed at saving certain intuitions about
what should and should not count as correct answers to why-questions.
For example, consider a straight, 40-foot high utility pole standing
perpendicular to the ground. A taut 50-foot wire is fastened to the
top of the pole and to a point on the ground 30 feet from the base of
the pole. Now consider the question:
and the intuitively incorrect answer 
Bromberger (1966, 105) argues that (22) does not count as a correct
answer to (21) on his theory in part because the following is not an
abnormic law:
Nor would (23) become an abnormic law if additional disjuncts were
added after ‘unless’.
Teller (1974) argues that while (22) may not count as a correct answer
to (21) on Bromberger’s theory, other answers that are as
objectionable as (22) do get counted as correct answers, such as this
“dispositional” answer to (21):
Teller (1974, 375) argues that Bromberger’s theory requires that
(24) count as a correct answer in virtue of the following abnormic
law:
Teller proposes other counterexamples by devising a method for turning
examples showing that Hempel’s deductive-nomological theory of
explanation is too permissive into examples showing that
Bromberger’s theory of why-questions is also too permissive.
Teller’s method exploits the fact that when abnormic laws are
rewritten in certain logically equivalent ways, the resulting
statements must then also count as abnormic laws.
A second major development in the theory of why-questions is the
account of van Fraassen (1980, ch. 5). Van Fraassen’s theory is
motivated by the idea that explanation is not a special relationship
between theory and reality. Rather, an explanation is just a
description of reality that serves a contextually determined
purpose, namely that of answering a why-question. Van Fraassen’s
theory is thus an erotetic (i.e., question-theoretic) theory of
explanation, as opposed to an account of why-questions in terms of
explanation. He offers this theory in the context of developing his
account of Constructive Empiricism. 
For van Fraassen, a why-question \(Q\) can be identified with a
triple \(\langle P,X,R\rangle\), where \(P\) is a
true proposition (the topic of the question); \(X\) is a
set of propositions to which \(P\) belongs and of which \(P\) is
the only member that is true (the contrast class of
\(Q)\); and \(R\) is a contextually determined relation of
explanatory relevance, which holds between a proposition and the
topic/contrast-class pair \(\langle P,X\rangle\). The standard
linguistic expression of \(Q\) is:
For example, consider ‘Why do birds in the northern hemisphere
go south for the winter, whereas mammals and reptiles do not?’
In this case, \(P\) is the proposition that birds in the northern
hemisphere go south for the winter, and \(X\) is the set containing
\(P\) along with the proposition that mammals in the northern
hemisphere go south for the winter and the proposition that reptiles
in the northern hemisphere go south for the winter. The contrast class
parameter allows one to distinguish different why-questions that have
the same topic. Thus one can ask why northern hemisphere
birds (rather than mammals or reptiles) go south for the
winter, and this is different from asking why northern hemisphere
birds go south (rather than north or west) for the winter.
Until one specifies a contrast class, van Fraassen argues, a
particular why-question has not been identified or posed. Like van
Fraassen, Garfinkel (1981) advances a view on which explanatory
contrast takes center stage, but we will focus here on the details of
van Fraassen’s account. See Temple 1988 for a comparison of van
Fraassen’s and Garfinkel’s respective treatments of
explanatory contrast.
Suppose that
\(X=\{P,P_1 ,\ldots ,P_k,(\ldots)\}\),
and that \(P\) is not one of the \(P_k\)s.
(Note that \(X\) may be finite or infinite.) Then, where \(A\)
is any proposition, van Fraassen (1980, 144) defines a direct answer
to \(Q\) to be any proposition having the following truth
conditions:
The standard wording of a direct answer (28) to \(Q\) uses the word
‘because’ in place of the second ‘and’ in
(27):
On van Fraassen’s view, the contribution of
‘because’ to the truth conditions of (28) is simply
boolean conjunction, as reflected in (27). The role of
‘because’ in (28) is to perform the pragmatic function of
indicating that (27) is being used for an explanatory purpose, not to
give a non-truth-functional dimension to the truth conditions of (28).
Proposition \(A\) (the core of answer (27)/(28)) is said to be
relevant to \(Q\) iff \(A\) bears the relevance relation
\(R\) to \(\langle P,X\rangle\). In general, to ask why is
to ask for a reason, and \(R\) varies according to the kind of
reason that is being requested in a given context. One can ask why in
order to request causal factors, to request a justification, to
request a purpose, to request a motive, to request a function, and so
on.
A why-question, according to van Fraassen (1980, 144–145)
presupposes (i) that its topic is true, (ii) that, in its contrast
class, only its topic is true, and (iii) that at least one proposition
bearing the explanatory relevance relation to the topic/contrast-class
pair is true. When the first or second presupposition fails (because
the contextually determined body of background knowledge in play does
not entail both (i) and (ii)), the why-question does not
arise. When the third presupposition fails, the why-question has
no answer even if it arises. For example, suppose that paresis
indeterministically strikes some people who have untreated syphilis.
Then, if ten people have untreated syphilis, and exactly one of them,
John, goes on to contract paresis, there may be no answer to the
question ‘Why did John, in contrast to the other nine, contract
paresis?’ Since paresis develops indeterministically from
syphilis, nothing favors John (in contrast to the other nine syphilis
patients) as being likely to develop paresis. On the other hand, if
Bill and Sarah never had syphilis, the question ‘Why did John,
in contrast to Bill and Sarah, develop paresis?’ does have an
answer: ‘John developed paresis, in contrast to Bill and Sarah,
because John had syphilis but Bill and Sarah did not.’ In this
case, as in the first, the why-question requests causal factors that
led to John’s getting paresis while the others mentioned in the
contrast class did not. In both cases, then, the same relevance
relation \(R\) is in play because the same kind of information is
requested, namely causal factors leading to the truth of the topic in
contrast to the other members of the contrast class. If there are no
such causal factors, as in the first version of the paresis case, the
question is to be rejected. If, as in the second version of the
paresis case, there are such factors, so that at least one proposition
bears the relevance relation to the topic/contrast-class pair, then a
candidate answer \(A\) is evaluated according to three criteria:
how acceptable or likely \(A\) is, the degree to which \(A\)
favors \(P\) over other members of \(X\), and whether \(A\)
is made irrelevant by other answers.
Van Fraassen’s theory of why-questions is intended as a theory
of explanation, but why-explanation seems not to be the only kind of
explanation there is. Cross (1991) argues that answers to
how-questions are explanations, too, and, building on van
Fraassen’s theory of why-questions, Cross offers a theory of
how-questions that ultimately unifies why- and how-explanation in a
single theory of explanatory questions.
Firstly, it must be noted that not every how-question requests an
explanation. For example, ‘How far is it to Cleveland?’
asks for a distance, not an explanation. In general, according to
Cross (1991, 248), a how-question is explanation-seeking whenever
‘how’ can be paraphrased as ‘in what way’.
Secondly, ways, like reasons, come in a variety of kinds (Cross 1991,
248–9):
Thirdly, Cross argues that one can see phenomena of explanatory
contrast in how-questions in such examples as the following: 
The linguistic form (31) of a how-question and its answer (32),
according to Cross, are as follows, where, as in van Fraassen’s
theory, the contrast class \(X\) is a set of propositions
containing \(P\): 
Notice, however, that whereas in (30a) the propositions in \(X\)
other than \(P\) are false, in (30b) all three members of \(X\)
are true: birds, mammals, and reptiles reproduce. This, Cross argues,
reflects the fact that how-questions can exhibit two different kinds
of explanatory contrast. By asking (30a) one requests an answer that
highlights those special qualities of DNA that enable it to replicate
and that benzene and hexane do not possess. By asking (30b), on the
other hand, one requests an answer that highlights the differences
between the way in which reptiles reproduce and the ways in which
mammals and birds reproduce. The latter kind of explanatory contrast
also appears to be at play when (30b) is re-worded this way:
In view of this, Cross introduces a contextual parameter in his
account of how-questions to indicate whether a given how-question
presupposes that all members of the contrast class are true or whether
it presupposes that all members of the contrast class other than
\(P\) are false. In the resulting account, a how-question is an
ordered quadruple \(\langle P,X,R,n\rangle\),
where \(P\) is the topic of the question; \(X\) is the contrast
class, which is a set of propositions to which \(P\) belongs;
\(R\) is a contextually determined relation of explanatory
relevance, which holds between a proposition and the
topic/contrast-class pair \(\langle P,X\rangle\), and \(n\)
is the contrast value 0 or 1. If \(n = 0\), the question
presupposes that in \(X\) only \(P\) is true; if \(n = 1\),
the question presupposes that all of the members of \(X\) are true.
The explanatory relevance relation \(R\) is to be understood as
varying from context to context depending on what kind of way is being
requested in that context. Finally, Cross (1991, 252) defines a direct
answer to a how-question as follows:
Having found examples in which how-questions have contrast value 1,
Cross argues that why-questions, too, can presuppose that the other
members of their contrast classes are true. Consider a therapy meeting
for alcoholics in which each member of the group is asked the
following question:
In this case it appears that the asker is requesting an answer that
highlights factors that distinguish the alcoholism of the person to
whom the question is addressed from that of the others in the group.
This and other evidence leads Cross to conclude that how- and
why-questions are the same kind of question—both are
explanatory questions—and both can be represented as
having the structure \(\langle P,X,R,n\rangle\).
If a proposition \(A\) must be a reason for \(P\) (in
contrast to the rest of \(X)\) in order to bear relation \(R\)
to \(\langle P,X,n\rangle\), then the question is worded
with ‘why’ and the answer with ‘because’; if
\(A\) must be a way for \(P\) to be the case (in
contrast to the rest of \(X)\) in order to bear relation \(R\)
to \(\langle P,X,n\rangle\), then the question is worded
with ‘how’ and the answer with ‘by’, ‘in
this way’, or similar wording. 
It is possible to accept Cross’s theory as a theory of
how-questions only and to resist the final move of unifying how- and
why-questions into a single species of question. The unification that
Cross proposes assumes that why-questions can have contrast value 1,
but Risjord (2000, 73–4) argues that instead of accepting that
(35) is a why-question with contrast value 1, one can instead analyze
it as a why-question with contrast value 0 that makes reference to the
topics of other why-questions (also having contrast value 0) that have
been or could be raised in the given context.
Kitcher and Salmon (1987) were early critics of van Fraassen’s
theory of why-questions as a theory of explanation. They object (1987,
319) that the lack of constraints on the relevance relation \(R\)
“allows just about anything to count as the answer to just about
any [why-]question.” Other critics of van Fraassen’s
theory include Ruben (1987) and Temple (1988), who argue that
explanatory contrast is an unnecessary complication because any
contrastive why-question ‘why \(P\) (in contrast to
\(Q)\)?’ is equivalent to the non-contrastive why-question
‘why P&\(\neg\)Q?’. Risjord (2000, 70) rebuts this
reduction of the contrastive to the non-contrastive by arguing that it
leads to the untenable result that whenever \(P\) entails both
\(\neg\)Q and \(\neg\)R, ‘why \(P\) (in contrast to
\(Q)\)?’ must then be logically equivalent to ‘why
\(P\) (in contrast to \(R)\)?’, since
\(P \amp \neg Q\) is logically equivalent to
\(P \amp \neg R\) if \(P\) entails \(\neg Q\) and
\(\neg R\). But questions of these forms need not be equivalent,
since they may call for different answers. For example, if Art is a
vegan and is allergic to chocolate, a correct answer to ‘Why did
Art eat fruit for dessert (rather than eating ice cream and skipping
the fruit)?’ will cite his being a vegan and not his chocolate
allergy, whereas a correct answer to ‘Why did Art eat fruit for
dessert (rather than eating chocolate and skipping the fruit)?’
will cite his chocolate allergy but not his being a vegan.
Where van Fraassen’s theory places few restrictions on the
contrast class or foils of a why-question, some authors have
argued that the set of possible foils is constrained in various ways.
One example is Sober (1986), who contends that the presuppositions of
‘Why \(P\) rather than \(Q\)?’ include a two-part
common cause presupposition, namely that (1) the truth of \(P\) and
the falsity of \(Q\) trace back to a common cause, and (2) the
common cause discriminates \(P\) from \(Q\) in the sense that it
makes \(P\) more likely than \(Q\). Both presuppositions fail
for Sober’s (1986, 145) example of the unanswerable question,
‘Why is Kodaly a Hungarian rather than a vegetarian?’
Another author who argues for additional constraints on foils is
Lipton (1990), who aims in part to improve on Lewis’s (1986)
account of causal explanation. Lipton contends that a causal answer to
‘Why \(P\) rather than \(Q\)?’ must cite a cause of
\(P\) and the absence of a corresponding event in the history of
\(\neg Q\), i.e., a causal difference between \(P\) and
\(\neg Q\). Lipton (1990, 256) calls this The Difference Condition.
The central requirement for a sensible contrastive question is that
fact and (negated) foil have a similar causal history against which
the differences stand out (Lipton 1990, 258). According to Barnes
(1994), Lipton is correct that fact and (negated) foil must have a
similar causal history, but Barnes goes further and claims that a
why-question presupposes that the fact and foil can be viewed as
culminating outcomes of some single type of natural causal process
(Barnes 1994, 50).
In recent years the topic of why-questions has been somewhat neglected
by philosophers, at least compared to other topics in the theory of
questions. One notable exception to this is Hintikka and Halonen 1995,
which develops a theory of why-questions in the context of
Hintikka’s interrogative model of inquiry. Another notable
development is Skow 2016, which begins with two key ideas: first, that
a theory of explanation ought to be a theory of answers to
why-questions, and, second, that a theory of answers to why-questions
is a theory of reasons-why. Skow goes on to defend the view that
reasons-why are causes or grounds, and he argues that reasons-why come
in levels. For example, at one level there are reasons why \(P\),
and at a different level there are reasons why \(Q\) is a reason
why \(P\).
Interrogative expressions can be embedded (as wh-complements or
indirect questions) into attitude contexts to form sentences that are
declarative, as when someone is said to know, tell, care, or wonder
who, what, whether, how, or why. Where the attitude in question is
knowledge, these sorts of examples are called knowledge-wh.
Knowledge-how in the sense of skill-possession, as in ‘Smith
knows how to ride a bicycle’, has generated a literature of its
own and is treated elsewhere (see the entry on
 knowledge how).
 
The discussion of knowledge-wh has focused mostly on whether-, what-,
which-, and who-complements, as in these examples:
Groenendijk and Stokhof (1982) provide a rich source of examples of
intuitively valid and invalid inferences involving wh-complements,
such as the following intuitively valid inference (179):
Knowledge-wh figures explicitly in the imperative-epistemic theory
of wh-questions developed by Åqvist (1965). The
imperative-epistemic account is further developed by Hintikka (1975,
1976) and has been influential among philosophers of science
interested in models of inquiry and discovery, such as Kleiner
(1993).
According to the imperative-epistemic account, to ask a question is to
issue an imperative requiring the addressee to bring it about that the
speaker knows the answer to the question. Knowledge-wh comes into it
because to know the answer is to be in a state that can be described
using a knowledge-wh sentence. For example, according to the
imperative-epistemic account, question (41) is to be understood as
imperative (42):
and question (43) is to be understood as imperative (44):
Is a wh-complement occurring in a longer sentence a meaningful unit?
If so, what does it denote? Several early approaches to wh-complements
can be organized around answers to these questions.
Assuming that wh-complements are meaningful units of the sentences in
which they occur, one option (Groenendijk and Stokhof 1982) is to take
wh-complements to denote individual propositions. A second option
(Karttunen 1977) is to take wh-complements to denote sets of
propositions. In either case, John’s knowing who walks consists
in the obtaining of a relation between John and the denotation of the
expression ‘who walks’. On the view that wh-complements
denote individual propositions, wh-complements and that-complements
are treated uniformly, and Groenendijk and Stokhof (1982) contend that
this uniform treatment is a virtue of their theory. Lewis (1982)
favors the same sort of account, but Lewis applies it only to
whether-complements.
Karttunen, a proponent of the second option, takes wh-complements to
denote sets of true propositions, so that ‘what John
reads’ denotes (Karttunen 1977, 20) “a set which contains,
for each thing that John reads, the proposition that he reads
it.” On Groenendijk and Stokhof’s account, by contrast,
‘what John reads’ denotes the proposition that is true in
a possible world if and only if the set of things that John reads in
that world equals the set of things John in fact reads. That is,
‘what John reads’ denotes a proposition that entails for
each thing John reads that he reads it and for each thing John does
not read that he does not read it. Thus if one knows what John reads,
it follows on Groenendijk and Stokhof’s account (but not on
Karttunen’s) that one knows what John does not read. Also, on
Groenendijk and Stokhof’s account, the difference between
knowing-that and knowing-wh amounts to a difference in what we might
call the rigidity of the complement. Consider the claim that
I know that John reads Moby Dick and the claim that I know
what John reads. The term ‘that John reads Moby Dick
’ refers to the same proposition at every possible world; the
term ‘what John reads’ refers to different propositions at
worlds at which John reads different things (and refers to the
proposition that John reads Moby Dick at those worlds at
which Moby Dick is the one and only thing that John reads).
If wh-complements are not meaningful units of the sentences in which
they occur, one option is to interpret wh-complements
“contextually”, as Russell interpreted definite
descriptions. Indeed, Hintikka (1976, Chapter 4) argues that
knowledge-wh sentences like (37)-(39) are ambiguous between two
readings: a universal reading and an existential reading. In the case
of (37), Hintikka’s two readings are as follows: 
Karttunen (1977, 7) disputes the existence of Hintikka’s
ambiguity. 
Braun (2006) offers a very different account of knowledge-wh on which
the question-answer relationship underlying knowledge-wh is much less
formal, and this makes it very easy to have knowledge-wh on
Braun’s account.
Consider this example:
Examples like (46) are identity questions, which seem
intuitively to call for a dimension of context-dependence that
standard theories of the question-answer relationship do not
accommodate. The idea is that different ways of identifying Hong Oak
Yun are relevant in different contexts; accordingly, different
propositions count as answers (or as correct answers) to (46) in
different contexts. Aloni (2005) provides a recent example of a theory
designed to accommodate this intuition. Braun (2006) rejects the
intuition entirely. 
According to Braun’s (2006, 26) information provision
account of questions, “to answer a question is simply to provide
information about the subject matter of the question.” That is,
(46) is answered by any proposition that provides information about
Hong Oak Yun, even the proposition expressed by ‘Hong Oak Yun is
a person who is over three inches tall’. This answer may not
satisfy or be useful to or be informative for the speaker who poses
(46), but it counts as an answer despite these purely pragmatic
failings, according to Braun’s theory. To know who Hong Oak
Yun is, according to Braun, is simply to know the truth of a
proposition that answers (46), which is to say, to know the truth of
any proposition that provides information about Hong Oak Yun.
Braun’s view contrasts with the contextualism of Boër and
Lycan (1986) according to which knowing who Hong Oak Yun is requires
knowing a proposition that provides contextually relevant information
about Hong Oak Yun. Another contextualist alternative to Braun’s
view is the view of Masto (2010), according to which (46) denotes a
contextually determined set of possible answers, and knowing who Hong
Oak Yun is consists in being able to choose or recognize the correct
answer from that contextually determined set.
Where Boër and Lycan view knowing-wh as context-relative,
Schaffer (2007) views it as question-relative. The problem, according
to Schaffer, is that if knowledge-wh is reduced to knowledge-that and
is not question-relative, then cases of knowledge-wh that should be
distinguished will not be distinguished. Schaffer calls this the
Problem of Convergent Knowledge. For example, suppose that (47) is
true:
On a non-question-relative account of knowledge-wh that reduces
knowledge-wh to knowledge-that, all three of the following will be
equivalent because all three can be reduced to (47): 
Schaffer argues that sentences like (48a–c) are not equivalent.
According to Schaffer’s account, assuming the cat is indeed on
the mat, to know where the cat is is to know that the cat is on the
mat relative to the question ‘Where is the cat?’, whereas
to know what is on the mat is to know that the cat is on the mat
relative to the question ‘What is on the mat?’. Schaffer
argues, in the end, that all knowledge, including knowledge-that, is
question-relative. Aloni and Égré (2010) offer a
different take on Schaffer’s Problem of Convergent Knowledge,
arguing that it reveals a pragmatic ambiguity concerning what it means
to know the answer to a wh-question. 
Brogaard (2009) rejects both reductionist views (which, like
Hintikka’s, reduce knowledge-wh to knowledge-that) and
anti-reductionist views (which, like Schaffer’s, analyze
knowledge-wh as question-relative knowledge-that), arguing instead
that wh-complements are predicates and knowledge-wh is a special kind
of de re knowledge. For example, on Brogaard’s view, the logical
form of (48c) is:
Knowledge-wh is only one of a broader category of attitudes
corresponding to what Lahiri (2002) calls responsive
predicates. It is characteristic of responsive predicates that
they can accept both interrogative and declarative complements, as in
‘Mary knows/remembers/forgets who runs’ and ‘Mary
knows/remembers/forgets that John runs’. Responsive predicates
contrast with what Lahiri (2002) calls rogative predicates,
such as ‘wonder’, ‘be curious’, and
‘inquire’. Rogative predicates can accept interrogative
complements but cannot accept declarative complements. For example,
one can inquire who ate the last doughnut, but one cannot inquire that
John ate the last doughnut. The distinction between rogative and
responsive predicates turns out to have epistemological as well as
semantic significance, as it underlies Friedman’s (2013)
argument that there is a category of attitudes that have
questions, not propositions, as their contents. Friedman
calls these the interrogative attitudes, and they are
precisely the attitudes denoted by rogative predicates. 
Within the category of responsive predicates Lahiri (2002, 287)
distinguishes the veridical from the non-veridical.
Veridical-responsive predicates include ‘know’,
‘remember’, and ‘forget’;
non-veridical-responsive predicates include ‘be certain’,
‘agree (about)’, and ‘conjecture (about)’.
Whereas a veridical-responsive predicate expresses a relation to the
correct answer to its interrogative complement, a
non-veridical-responsive predicate expresses a relation to a possible
(but not necessarily the correct) answer. For example, ‘Jane
remembers who won the lottery’ entails that Jane has knowledge
that correctly answers the question ‘Who won the
lottery?’, whereas ‘Jane is certain about who won the
lottery’ entails that Jane is certain of the truth of a
proposition that may or may not correctly answer that same question.
Other classifications of question-embedding verbs exist and are
surveyed by Lahiri (2002, 284–291). 
For a detailed critique of the recent literature on knowledge-wh, see
Chapter 2 of Stanley 2011. Parent (2014) provides a survey of the
recent literature about knowledge-wh organized around three issues:
the reducibility of knowledge-wh to knowledge-that, the relativity of
knowledge-wh to a contrast proposition, and the issue of whether the
context-sensitivity of knowing-wh is to be understood as a semantic or
a pragmatic phenomenon. The Uegaki manuscript listed below under Other
Internet Resources provides an overview of recent work on the
semantics of responsive predicates generally and is organized around
four approaches: the reduction of questions to propositions, the
reduction of propositions to questions, the uniformity approach (on
which declarative and interrogative complements of a responsive
predicate are of the same semantic type), and the ambiguity approach
(which postulates distinct proposition-taking and question-taking
readings of a given responsive predicate).
