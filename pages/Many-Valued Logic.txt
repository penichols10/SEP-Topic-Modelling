There are three kinds of semantics for systems of many-valued
logic.
We discuss these in turn.
The most suitable way of defining a system \(\bS\) of
many-valued logic is to fix the characteristic logical matrix for its
language, i.e. to fix:
and additionally,
A well-formed formula \(A\) of a propositional language counts
as valid under some valuation \(\alpha\) (which maps the set of
propositional variables into the set of truth degrees) iff it has a
designated truth degree under \(\alpha\). And \(A\) is logically
valid or a tautology iff it is valid under all
valuations.
In the case of a first-order language, such a well-formed formula
\(A\) counts as valid under an interpretation \(\alpha\) of
the language iff it has a designated truth degree under this
interpretation and all assignments of objects from the universe of
discourse of this interpretation to the object variables. \(A\)
counts as logically valid iff it is valid under all
interpretations.
Like in classical logic, such an interpretation has to provide
A model of some set \(\Sigma\) of well-formed formulas is a
valuation \(\alpha\) or an interpretation \(\alpha\) such that all \(A\)
∈ \(\Sigma\) are valid under \(\alpha\) . That \(\Sigma\) entails
\(A\) means that each model of \(\Sigma\) is also a model of
\(A\).
There is a second type of semantics for systems \(\bS\)
of many-valued logic which is based on a whole characteristic class
\(\bK\) of (similar) algebraic structures. Each such
algebraic structure has to provide all the data which have to be
provided by a characteristic logical matrix for the language of
\(\bS\).
The notion of validity of a formula \(A\) with respect to an
algebraic structure from \(\bK\) is defined as if this
structure would form a logical matrix. And logical validity
here means validity for all structures from the class
\(\bK\).
The type of algebraic structures which form such a characteristic
class \(\bK\) for some system \(\bS\) of MVL
usually may come from two different sources. A first source may be
determined by extralogical considerations which distinguish some such
class of algebraic structures. If a system \(\bS\) of MVL
is, however, determined syntactically or by a single characteristic
matrix, such a class of algebraic structures often is determined by the
(syntactical or semantical) Lindenbaum algebra of \(\bS\),
and in such a case often plays also a crucial role within an algebraic
completeness proof. The algebraic structures in \(\bK\) have
a similar role for \(\bS\) as the Boolean algebras do for
classical logic.
For particular systems of MVL one has e.g. the following
characteristic classes of algebraic structures:
For the first two of these examples one has, historically, the logic
determined by a characteristic matrix, and the corresponding class of
algebraic structures determined later on. For the third example the
situation is different: BL was designed to be the logic of all
continuous t-norms, and from this extralogical approach the class of
all divisible residuated lattices which satisfy prelinearity was
found.
From a philosophical point of view, however, it usually would be
preferable to have a semantic foundation for a system of MVL which uses
a single characteristic logical matrix. But, from a formal point of
view, both approaches are equally important, and the algebraic
semantics turns out to be the more general approach.
There are various ways in which
 logic and games can be related.
 Dialogical logic, e.g.,
 offers a game-theoretic semantics for classical as
well as for intuitionistic logic: a formula counts as valid if a
proponent who states this formula has a winning strategy over possible
attacks an opponent is allowed to realize.
In the context of the relationship between fuzzy sets and many-valued
logic, an approach toward a game-oriented look at logical validity was
offered by Robin Giles. Starting in 1975, he proposed in a series of
papers Giles (1975,1976,1979), and again in Giles (1988), a general
treatment of reasoning with vague predicates by means of a formal
system based upon a convenient dialogue interpretation. He had already
used this dialogue interpretation in other papers, such as Giles 1974,
which deals with subjective belief and the foundations of physics. The
main idea is to let “a sentence represent a belief by
expressing it tangibly in the form of a bet”.  The betting
concerns the actual outcomes of dispersive experiments with different
possible results of known probability. In this setting then a
“sentence \(\psi\) is considered to follow from sentences
\(\phi_{1},\ldots,\phi_{n}\) just when he who accepts
the bets \(\phi_{1},\ldots,\phi_{n}\) can at the same
time bet \(\psi\) without fear of loss”.
The (formal) language obtained in this way is closely related to
Łukasiewicz’s infinite-valued logic \(\rL_{\infty}\): in fact
the two systems coincide if one assigns to a sentence \(\phi\) the truth
value \(1-\langle\phi\rangle\), with \(\langle\phi \rangle\) for the risk
value of asserting \(\phi\). And he even adds the remark “that,
with this dialogue interpretation, Łukasiewicz logic is exactly
appropriate for the formulation of the ‘fuzzy set theory’
first described by L.A. Zadeh (1965); indeed, it is not too much to
claim that \(\rL_{\infty}\) is related to fuzzy set theory exactly
as classical logic is related to ordinary set theory”.
Different versions and generalizations of these dialogue games have
been studied recently. Various aspects of these developments are
discuss, e.g., in Fermüller (2008) and Fermüller/Roschger
(2014). Such approaches are not only able to provide game semantics
for e.g. Gödel logics and product logic. There are also bridges
which connect such games with the design of sequent calculi for
many-valued logics, cf. Fermüller/Metcalfe (2009).
There is also a further type of dialogue games related to
\(m\)-valued Łukasiewicz logic: a proponent is asking for
information, and the answering opponent is allowed to lie up to
\(m\) times. Such “Ulam games with lies” have been
introduced by Mundici (1992).
The main types of logical calculi are all available for systems of
MVL:
However, some of the above are available only for finitely valued
systems. The present state of the art for a wide class of infinitely
valued logics is presented in Metcalfe/Olivetti/Gabbay (2009).
These calculi are formed in the same way as the corresponding
calculi for classical logic: some set of axioms is used
together with a set of inference rules. The notion of
derivation is the usual one.
In addition to the usual types of sequent calculi, researchers have
also recently started to discuss ‘hypersequent’ calculi for
systems of MVL. Hypersequents are finite multisets, i.e. finite unordered lists of ordinary
sequents.
For finitely valued systems, particularly \(m\)-valued ones,
there are also sequent calculi which work with generalized
sequents. In the \(m\)-valued case, these are sequences of
length \(m\) of sets of formulas.
The tree structure of the tableaux remains the same in these calculi
as in the tableau calculi for classical logic. The labels of the nodes
become more general objects, namely, signed formulas. A signed
formula is a pair, consisting of a sign and a well-formed
formula. A sign is either a truth degree, or a set of truth
degrees.
Tableau calculi with signed formulas are usually restricted to
finite-valued systems of MVL, so that they can be dealt with in an
effective way.
The main systems of MVL often come as families which comprise
uniformly defined finite-valued as well as infinite-valued systems.
Here is a list:
The systems \(\rL_{m}\) and \(\rL_{\infty}\) are
defined by the logical matrix which has either some finite set
of rationals within the real unit interval, or the whole unit
interval
as the truth degree set. The degree 1 is the only designated truth
degree.
The main connectives of these systems are a strong and a weak
conjunction, \(\amp\) and \(\wedge\), respectively, given by the truth degree
functions
a negation connective \(\neg\) determined by
and an implication connective \(\rightarrow\) with truth degree function
Often, two disjunction connectives are also used. These are defined in
terms of \(\amp\) and \(\wedge\), respectively, via the usual de
Morgan laws using \(\neg\). For the first-order Łukasiewicz systems
one adds two quantifiers \(\forall\), \(\exists\) in such a way that the
truth degree of \(\forall xH(x)\) is the infimum of all
the relevant truth degrees of \(H(x)\), and that the truth degree
of \(\exists xH(x)\) is the supremum of all the relevant
truth degrees of \(H(x)\).
The systems \(\rG_{m}\) and \(\rG_{\infty}\) are
defined by the logical matrix which has either some finite set
of rationals within the real unit interval, or the whole unit
interval
as the truth degree set. The degree 1 is the only designated truth
degree.
The main connectives of these systems are a conjunction \(\wedge\) and a
disjunction \(\vee\) determined by the truth degree functions
an implication connective \(\rightarrow\)  with truth degree function
and a negation connective \(\sim\) with truth degree function
For the first-order Gödel systems one adds two quantifiers
\(\forall\), \(\exists\) in such a way that the truth degree of
\(\forall xH(x)\) is the infimum of all the
relevant truth degrees of \(H(x)\), and that the truth
degree of \(\exists xH(x)\) is the supremum of
all the relevant truth degrees of \(H(x)\).
For infinite valued systems with truth degree set
the influence of fuzzy set theory since the mid-1980s initiated the study
of a whole class of such systems of MVL.
These systems are basically determined by a (possibly
non-idempotent) strong conjunction connective \(\amp_{\rT}\) which
has as corresponding truth degree function a t-norm \(\rT\), i.e. a
binary operation \(\rT\) in the unit interval which is associative,
commutative, non-decreasing, and has the degree 1 as a neutral
element:
For all those t-norms which have the sup-preservation
property
there is a standard way to introduce a related implication
connective \(\rightarrow_{\rT}\) with the truth degree function
This implication connective is connected with the t-norm \(\rT\) by the
crucial adjointness condition
which determines \(\rightarrow_{\rT}\) uniquely for each \(\rT\) with
sup-preservation property.
The language is further enriched with a negation connective,
\(-_{\rT}\), determined by the truth degree function
This forces the language to have also a truth degree constant
\(\uO\) to denote the truth degree 0 because then \(-_{\rT}\)
becomes a definable connective.
Usually one adds as two further connectives a (weak) conjunction
\(\wedge\) and a disjunction \(\vee\) with truth degree functions.
For t-norms which are continuous functions (in the standard sense of
continuity for real functions of two variables) these additional
connectives become even definable. Suitable definitions are
Particular cases of such t-norm related systems are the infinite
valued Łukasiewicz and Gödel systems \(\rL_{\infty}\),
\(\rG_{\infty}\), and also the product logic which has the
usual arithmetic product as its basic t-norm.
From an analytical point of view, for a t-norm \(\rT\) their
sup-preservation property is the left-continuity of this binary
function \(\rT\), i.e. the property that each one of the unary
functions \(\rT_{a}(x)=\rT(a,x)\) is left-continuous. And the
continuity of such a t-norm T can be characterized through the
algebraic divisibility condition
The class of all t-norms is very large, and up to now not really
well understood. Even for those t-norms which have the sup-preservation
property the structural understanding is far from complete, but much
better as for the general case: a discussion of the recent state of the
art is given by Jenei (2004). Sufficiently well understood is only the
further subclass of continuous t-norms: they are nicely composed out of
isomorphic copies of the Łukasiewicz t-norm, the product t-norm,
and the Gödel t-norm, i.e. the min-operation, as explained e.g. in
Gottwald (2001).
Actually one is able to axiomatize t-norm based systems for some
particular classes of t-norms. As a fundamental result, Hájek
(1998) has given an axiomatization of the logic BL of all continuous
t-norms. Besides the previously mentioned algebraic semantics this
logic has, as conjectured by Hajek and proved in
Cignoli/Esteva/Godo/Torrens (2000), as another algebraic semantics the
class of all t-norm based structures whose t-norm is a continuous
function. Based upon this work, Esteva and Godo (2001) conjectured an
axiomatization for the logic MTL of all t-norms which have the
sup-preservation property, and Jenei/Montagna (2002) proved that this
really is an adequate axiomatization. And Esteva/Godo/Montagna (2004)
offer a method to axiomatize the logic of each single continuous t-norm: 
they provide an algorithm which gives for each particular continuous t-norm
\(\rT\) a finite list of axiom schemata which, if added to the logic BL
of all continuous t-norms, yield an adequate axiomatization of the particular 
t-norm based logic for \(\rT\).
The axiomatization of further t-norm based systems, as well as the
question for t-norm based quantifiers, are recent research problems.
The main focus is given by the following two aspects which concern
modifications of the expressive power of these t-norm based systems:
(i) strengthenings of this expressibility by forming systems with
additional negation operators or with multiple t-norm based conjunction
operations; (ii) modifications of this expressibility e.g. by deleting
the truth degree constant \(\uO\) from the language, but adding an
implication connective to the basic vocabulary, and (iii)
generalizations which modify the basic t-norms into non-commutative
“pseudo-t-norms” and thus lead to logics with
non-commutative conjunction connectives. Surveys for those developments
had been given by Gottwald/Hájek (2005), Gottwald (2008), and
Cintula/Hájek (2010). 
 A nearly complete presentation of the state of the art in 2011 is
the monograph Cintula/Hájek/Noguera (2011). And the particular
contributions of P. Hájek to these developments are honored in
the book Montagna (2015). 
3-valued systems seem to be particularly simple cases which offer
intuitive interpretations of the truth degrees; these systems include
only one additional degree besides the classical truth values.
The mathematician and logician Kleene used a third truth degree for
“undefined” in the context of partial recursive
functions. His connectives were the negation, the weak conjunction,
and the weak disjunction of the 3-valued Łukasiewicz system
together with a definable conjunction \(\wedge_{+}\) and a definable
implication \(\rightarrow_{+}\) determined by truth degree functions
with the following function tables (these latter have truth degree
½ iff one of their constituents has truth degree ½):
Here ½ is the third truth degree “undefined”. In
this Kleene system, the degree 1 is the only designated truth
degree.
 Blau (1978) used a different system as an inherent logic of
natural language. In Blau’s system, both degrees 1 and ½ are
designated.  Other interpretations of the third truth degree ½,
for example as “senseless”, “undetermined”, or
“paradoxical”, motivated the study of other 3-valued
systems.
This particularly interesting system of MVL was the result of
research on
 relevance logic,
 but it
also has significance for computer science applications. Its truth
degree set may be taken as
and the truth degrees interpreted as indicating (e.g. with respect
to a database query for some particular state of affairs) that there
is
This set of truth degrees has two natural (lattice) orderings:
Given the inf and the sup under the truth ordering, there are truth
degree functions for a conjunction and a disjunction connective. A
negation is, in a natural way, determined by a truth degree function
which exchanges the degrees \(\{\bot\}\) and \(\{\top\}\), and which leaves
the degrees \(\{\bot, \top\}\) and \(\varnothing\) fixed.
Actually, there is no standard candidate for a implication
connective, and the choice of the designated truth degrees depends on
the intended applications:
The choice of suitable entailment relations is still an open
research topic.
This 4-valued system has an interesting interpretation in the
context of information bases stored in a computer which was explained by
Belnap (1977). A more recent generalization by Shramko/Wansing (2005) to
knowledge bases in computer networks leads to 16-valued systems, which
are e.g. also studied by Odintsov (2009).
 

These 16-valued systems are also of interest from a philosophical
point of view and extensively presented in the monograph
Shramko/Wansing (2011).
The general problem of finding an intuitive understanding of the
truth degrees occasionally has a nice solution: one can consider them
as comprising different aspects of the evaluation of sentences. In such
a case of, say, \(k\) different aspects the truth degrees may be
chosen as \(k\)-tuples of values which evaluate the single
aspects. (And these, e.g., may be standard truth values.)
The truth degree functions over such \(k\)-tuples additionally
can be defined “componentwise” from truth degree (or: truth value)
functions for the values of the single components. In this manner,
\(k\) logical systems may be combined into one many-valued
product system.
In this way, the truth degrees of Dunn/Belnap’s 4-valued system can
be considered as evaluating two aspects of a state of affairs (SOA)
related to a database:
Both aspects can use standard truth values for this evaluation.
In this case, the conjunction, disjunction, and negation of
Dunn/Belnap’s 4-valued system are componentwise definable by
conjunction, disjunction, or negation, respectively, of classical
logic, i.e. this 4-valued system is a product of two copies of
classical two-valued logic.
Many-valued logic was motivated in part by philosophical goals which
were never achieved, and in part by formal considerations concerning
functional completeness. In the earlier years of development, this
caused some doubts about the usefulness of MVL. In the meantime,
however, interesting applications were found in diverse fields. Some of
these shall now be mentioned.
A challenging problem is the treatment of presuppositions in
linguistics, i.e. of assumptions that are only implicit in a given
sentence. So, for example, the sentence “The present king of Canada was
born in Vienna” has the existential presupposition that there
is a present king of Canada.
It is not a simple task to understand the propositional treatment of
such sentences, e.g. to give criteria for forming their negation, or
understanding the truth conditions of implications.
One type of solution for these problems refers to the use of many
truth degrees, e.g. to product systems with ordered pairs as
truth degrees: meaning that their components evaluate in parallel
whether the presupposition is met, and whether the sentence is true or
false. But 3-valued approaches have also been discussed.
Another type of ideas to use MVL tools in linguistics consists in
approaches toward the modeling of natural language phenomena. Basic
ideas and some applications are offered e.g. in
Novák/Perfilieva/ Močkoř (1999) and Novák
(2008).
A first type of application of systems of MVL to logic itself is to
use them to gain a better understanding of other systems of logic. In
this way the Gödel systems arose out of an approach to test
whether intuitionistic logic may be understood as a finitely valued
logic. The introduction of systems of MVL by Łukasiewicz (1920)
was initially guided by the (finally unsuccessful) idea of
understanding the notion of possibility, i.e. modal logic, in a
3-valued way.
A second type of application to logic is the merging of different
types of logical systems, e.g. the formulation of systems with graded
modalities. Melvin Fitting (1991/92) considers systems that define such
modalities by merging modal and many-valued logic, with intended
applications to problems of Artificial Intelligence.
A third type of application to logic is the modeling of partial
predicates and truth value gaps. However, this is possible only in so
far as these truth value gaps behave “truth functionally”, i.e. in so
far as the behavior of the truth value gaps in compound sentences can
be described by suitable truth functions. (This is not always the case,
e.g. it is not the case in formulations which use
supervaluations.)
How to understand the meaning of “truth” is an old philosophical
problem. A logical approach toward this problem consists in enriching a
formalized language \(L\) with a truth predicate \(T\), to be
applied to sentences of \(L\) – or, even better, to be
applied to sentences of the extension \(L_{T}\)
of \(L\) with the predicate \(T\).
Based upon this idea, a reasonable theory of such languages which
contain truth predicates was developed in the mid-1930s by A. Tarski.
One of the results was that such a language
\(L_{T}\), which contains its own truth predicate
\(T\) and has a certain richness in expressive power, is
necessarily inconsistent.
Another approach toward such languages \(L_{T}\) which contain their
own truth predicate \(T\) was offered by S. Kripke (1975) and is
essentially based upon the idea of considering \(T\) as a partial
predicate, i.e. as a predicate which has “truth value
gaps”. In a case Kripke (1975) considers, these truth value gaps
behave “truth functionally” and so can be treated like a
third truth degree. Their propagation in compound sentences then
becomes describable by suitable truth degree functions of three-valued
systems. In Kripke’s (1975) approach this reference was to
three-valued systems which S. C. Kleene (1938) had considered in the
(mathematical) context of partial functions and predicates in
recursion theory.
A second application of MVL inside philosophy is to the old paradoxes
like the Sorites (heap) or the falakros (bald
man). (See the entry
 Sorites paradox.)
 In the case of the Sorites, the paradox is as
follows:
Thus the true premise (i) gives a false conclusion (iii) via a
sequence of inferences using (ii). A rather natural solution inside an
extension of MVL with a graded notion of inference, often called
fuzzy logic, is to take the notion of heap as a vague
one, i.e. as a notion which may hold true of given objects only to some
(truth) degree. Additionally it is suitable to consider premise (ii) as
only partially true, however to a degree which is quite near to the
maximal degree 1. Then each single inference step is of the form:
However, this inference has to involve truth degrees for the
premises (a) and (ii), and has to provide a truth degree for the
conclusion (b). The crucial idea for the modeling of this type of
reasoning inside MVL is to make sure that the truth degree for (b) is
smaller than the truth degree for (a) in case the truth degree for (ii)
is smaller than the maximal one. In effect, then, the sentence \(n\)
grains of sand do not make a heap tends toward being false for an
increasing number \(n\) of grains.
Classical propositional logic is used as a technical tool for the
analysis and synthesis of some types of electrical circuits built up
from “switches” with two stable states, i.e. voltage
levels. A rather straightforward generalization allows the use of
an \(m\)-valued logic to discuss circuits built from similar
“switches” with \(m\) stable states. This whole field
of application of many-valued logic is called many-valued (or even:
fuzzy) switching. A good introduction is Epstein (1993).
AI is actually the most promising field of applications, which
offers a series of different areas in which systems of MVL have been
used.
A first area of application concerns vague notions and commonsense
reasoning, e.g. in expert systems. Both topics are modeled via fuzzy
sets and fuzzy logic, and these refer to suitable systems of MVL. Also,
in databases and in knowledge-based systems one likes to store vague
information.
A second area of application is strongly tied with this first one: the
automatization of data and knowledge mining. Here clustering methods
come into consideration; these refer via unsharp clusters to fuzzy
sets and MVL. In this context one is also interested in automated
theorem proving techniques for systems of MVL, as well as in methods
of logic programming for systems of MVL. Part of this trend is the
recent development of generalized description logics, so-called fuzzy
description logics, which allow the inclusion of technical tools
(truth degrees, connectives, graded predicates) from the field of MVL
into – from the point of view of full first-order logics:
rudimentary – systems of logic, so-called description logics, see
Straccia (2001), Hájek (2005), Stoilos et al. (2008).
There are three main topics inside mathematics which are related to
many-valued logic. The first one is the mathematical theory of fuzzy
sets, and the mathematical analysis of “fuzzy”, or approximate
reasoning. In both cases one refers to systems of MVL. The second topic
has been approaches toward consistency proofs for set theory using a
suitable system of MVL. And there is an – often only implicit –
reference to the basic ideas of MVL in independence proofs (e.g. for
systems of axioms) which often refer to logical matrices with more than
two truth degrees. However, here MVL is more a purely technical tool
because in these independence proofs one is not interested in an
intuitive understanding of the truth degrees at all.
 Many-valued logic as a separate subject was created by the Polish
logician and philosopher Łukasiewicz (1920), and developed first
in Poland. His first intention was to use a third, additional truth
value for “possible”, and to model in this way the
modalities “it is necessary that” and “it is
possible that”. This intended application to modal logic did not
materialize. The outcome of these investigations are, however, the
Łukasiewicz systems, and a series of theoretical results
concerning these systems.
Essentially parallel to the Łukasiewicz approach, the American
mathematician Post (1921) introduced the basic idea of additional truth
degrees, and applied it to problems of the representability of
functions.
Later on, Gödel (1932) tried to understand intuitionistic logic
in terms of many truth degrees. The outcome was the family of
Gödel systems, and a result, namely, that intuitionistic logic
does not have a characteristic logical matrix with only finitely many
truth degrees. A few years later, Jaskowski (1936) constructed an
infinite valued characteristic matrix for intuitionistic logic. It
seems, however, that the truth degrees of this matrix do not have a
nice and simple intuitive interpretation.
A philosophical application of 3-valued logic to the discussion of
paradoxes was proposed by the Russian logician Bochvar (1938), and a
mathematical one to partial function and relations by the American
logician Kleene (1938). Much later Kleene’s connectives also became
philosophically interesting as a technical tool to determine fixed
points in the revision theory of truth initiated by Kripke (1975).
The 1950s saw (i) an analytical characterization of the class of
truth degree functions definable in the infinite valued propositional
Łukasiewicz system by McNaughton (1951), (ii) a completeness proof
for the same system by Chang (1958, 1959) introducing the notion of
MV-algebra and a more traditional one by Rose/Rosser (1958), as well as
(iii) a completeness proof for the infinite valued propositional
Gödel system by Dummett (1959). The 1950s also saw an approach of
Skolem (1957) toward proving the consistency of set theory in the realm
of infinite valued logic.
In the 1960s, Scarpellini (1962) made clear that the first-order
infinite valued Łukasiewicz system is not (recursively)
axiomatizable. Hay (1963) as well as Belluce/Chang (1963) proved that
the addition of one infinitary inference rule leads to an
axiomatization of \(\rL_{\infty}\). And Horn (1969) presented a
completeness proof for first-order infinite valued Gödel logic.
Besides these developments inside pure many-valued logic, Zadeh (1965)
started an (application oriented) approach toward the formalization of
vague notions by generalized set theoretic means, which soon was
related by Goguen (1968/69) to philosophical applications, and which
later on inspired also a lot of theoretical considerations inside
MVL.
The 1970s mark a period of restricted activity in pure many-valued
logic. There was, however, a lot of work in the closely related area of
(computer science) applications of vague notions formalized as fuzzy
sets, initiated e.g. by Zadeh (1975, 1979). And there was an important
extension of MVL by a graded notion of inference and entailment in
Pavelka (1979).
In the 1980s, fuzzy sets and their applications remained a hot topic
that called for theoretical foundations by methods of many-valued
logic. In addition, there were the first complexity results e.g.
concerning the set of logically valid formulas in first-order infinite
valued Łukasiewicz logic, by Ragaz (1983). Mundici (1986) started
a deeper study of MV-algebras.
These trends have continued since the 1980s. Research has included
applications of MVL to fuzzy set theory and their applications,
detailed investigations of algebraic structures related to systems of
MVL, the study of graded notions of entailment, and investigations into
complexity issues for different problems in systems of MVL. This
research was complemented by interesting work on proof theory, on
automated theorem proving, by different applications in artificial
intelligence matters, and by a detailed study of infinite valued
systems based on t-norms – which now often are called
(mathematical) fuzzy logics.
