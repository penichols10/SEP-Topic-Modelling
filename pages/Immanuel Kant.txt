Immanuel Kant was born April 22, 1724 in Königsberg, near the
southeastern shore of the Baltic Sea. Today Königsberg has been
renamed Kaliningrad and is part of Russia. But during Kant’s lifetime
Königsberg was the capital of East Prussia, and its dominant
language was German. Though geographically remote from the rest of
Prussia and other German cities, Königsberg was then a major
commercial center, an important military port, and a relatively
cosmopolitan university
 town.[1]
Kant was born into an artisan family of modest means. His father was
a master harness maker, and his mother was the daughter of a harness
maker, though she was better educated than most women of her social
class. Kant’s family was never destitute, but his father’s trade was in
decline during Kant’s youth and his parents at times had to rely on
extended family for financial support. 
Kant’s parents were Pietist and he attended a Pietist school, the
Collegium Fridericianum, from ages eight through fifteen. Pietism was
an evangelical Lutheran movement that emphasized conversion, reliance
on divine grace, the experience of religious emotions, and personal
devotion involving regular Bible study, prayer, and
introspection. Kant reacted strongly against the forced soul-searching
to which he was subjected at the Collegium Fridericianum, in response
to which he sought refuge in the Latin classics, which were central to
the school’s curriculum. Later the mature Kant’s emphasis on reason
and autonomy, rather than emotion and dependence on either authority
or grace, may in part reflect his youthful reaction against
Pietism. But although the young Kant loathed his Pietist schooling, he
had deep respect and admiration for his parents, especially his
mother, whose “genuine religiosity” he described as
“not at all enthusiastic.” According to his biographer,
Manfred Kuehn, Kant’s parents probably influenced him much less
through their Pietism than through their artisan values of “hard
work, honesty, cleanliness, and independence,” which they taught
him by example.[2] 
Kant attended college at the University of Königsberg, known as
the Albertina, where his early interest in classics was quickly
superseded by philosophy, which all first year students studied and
which encompassed mathematics and physics as well as logic,
metaphysics, ethics, and natural law. Kant’s philosophy professors
exposed him to the approach of Christian Wolff (1679–1750), whose
critical synthesis of the philosophy of G. W. Leibniz (1646–1716) was
then very influential in German universities. But Kant was also exposed
to a range of German and British critics of Wolff, and there were
strong doses of Aristotelianism and Pietism represented in the
philosophy faculty as well. Kant’s favorite teacher was Martin Knutzen
(1713–1751), a Pietist who was heavily influenced by both Wolff and the
English philosopher John Locke (1632–1704). Knutzen introduced Kant to
the work of Isaac Newton (1642–1727), and his influence is visible in
Kant’s first published work, Thoughts on the True Estimation of Living
Forces (1747), which was a critical attempt to mediate a dispute in
natural philosophy between Leibnizians and Newtonians over the proper
measurement of force.
After college Kant spent six years as a private tutor to young children
outside Königsberg. By this time both of his parents had died and
Kant’s finances were not yet secure enough for him to pursue an
academic career. He finally returned to Königsberg in 1754 and
began teaching at the Albertina the following year. For the next four
decades Kant taught philosophy there, until his retirement from
teaching in 1796 at the age of seventy-two.
Kant had a burst of publishing activity in the years after he returned
from working as a private tutor. In 1754 and 1755 he published three
scientific works – one of which, Universal Natural History and Theory
of the Heavens (1755), was a major book in which, among other things,
he developed what later became known as the nebular hypothesis about
the formation of the solar system. Unfortunately, the printer went
bankrupt and the book had little immediate impact. To secure
qualifications for teaching at the university, Kant also wrote two
Latin dissertations: the first, entitled Concise Outline of Some
Reflections on Fire (1755), earned him the Magister degree; and the
second, New Elucidation of the First Principles of Metaphysical
Cognition (1755), entitled him to teach as an unsalaried lecturer. The
following year he published another Latin work, The Employment in
Natural Philosophy of Metaphysics Combined with Geometry, of Which
Sample I Contains the Physical Monadology (1756), in hopes of
succeeding Knutzen as associate professor of logic and metaphysics,
though Kant failed to secure this position. Both the New Elucidation,
which was Kant’s first work concerned mainly with metaphysics, and the
Physical Monadology further develop the position on the interaction of
finite substances that he first outlined in Living Forces. Both works
depart from Leibniz-Wolffian views, though not radically. The New
Elucidation in particular shows the influence of Christian August
Crusius (1715–1775), a German critic of
 Wolff.[3]
As an unsalaried lecturer at the Albertina Kant was paid directly by
the students who attended his lectures, so he needed to teach an
enormous amount and to attract many students in order to earn a living.
Kant held this position from 1755 to 1770, during which period he would
lecture an average of twenty hours per week on logic, metaphysics, and
ethics, as well as mathematics, physics, and physical geography. In his
lectures Kant used textbooks by Wolffian authors such as Alexander
Gottlieb Baumgarten (1714–1762) and Georg Friedrich Meier (1718–1777),
but he followed them loosely and used them to structure his own
reflections, which drew on a wide range of ideas of contemporary
interest. These ideas often stemmed from British sentimentalist
philosophers such as David Hume (1711–1776) and Francis Hutcheson
(1694–1747), some of whose texts were translated into German in the
mid-1750s; and from the Swiss philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau
(1712–1778), who published a flurry of works in the early 1760s. From
early in his career Kant was a popular and successful lecturer. He also
quickly developed a local reputation as a promising young intellectual
and cut a dashing figure in Königsberg society.
After several years of relative quiet, Kant unleashed another burst of
publications in 1762–1764, including five philosophical works. The
False Subtlety of the Four Syllogistic Figures (1762) rehearses
criticisms of Aristotelian logic that were developed by other German
philosophers. The Only Possible Argument in Support of a Demonstration
of the Existence of God (1762–3) is a major book in which Kant drew on
his earlier work in Universal History and New Elucidation to develop an
original argument for God’s existence as a condition of the internal
possibility of all things, while criticizing other arguments for God’s
existence. The book attracted several positive and some negative
reviews. In 1762 Kant also submitted an essay entitled Inquiry
Concerning the Distinctness of the Principles of Natural Theology and
Morality to a prize competition by the Prussian Royal Academy, though
Kant’s submission took second prize to Moses Mendelssohn’s winning
essay (and was published with it in 1764). Kant’s Prize Essay, as it is
known, departs more significantly from Leibniz-Wolffian views than his
earlier work and also contains his first extended discussion of moral
philosophy in print. The Prize Essay draws on British sources to
criticize German rationalism in two respects: first, drawing on Newton,
Kant distinguishes between the methods of mathematics and philosophy;
and second, drawing on Hutcheson, he claims that “an unanalysable
feeling of the good” supplies the material content of our moral
obligations, which cannot be demonstrated in a purely intellectual way
from the formal principle of perfection alone
 (2:299).[4] 
 These themes
reappear in the Attempt to Introduce the Concept of Negative Magnitudes
into Philosophy (1763), whose main thesis, however, is that the real
opposition of conflicting forces, as in causal relations, is not
reducible to the logical relation of contradiction, as Leibnizians
held. In Negative Magnitudes Kant also argues that the morality of an
action is a function of the internal forces that motivate one to act,
rather than of the external (physical) actions or their consequences.
Finally, Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and the Sublime
(1764) deals mainly with alleged differences in the tastes of men and
women and of people from different cultures. After it was published,
Kant filled his own interleaved copy of this book with (often
unrelated) handwritten remarks, many of which reflect the deep
influence of Rousseau on his thinking about moral philosophy in the
mid-1760s.
These works helped to secure Kant a broader reputation in Germany, but
for the most part they were not strikingly original. Like other German
philosophers at the time, Kant’s early works are generally concerned
with using insights from British empiricist authors to reform or
broaden the German rationalist tradition without radically undermining
its foundations. While some of his early works tend to emphasize
rationalist ideas, others have a more empiricist emphasis. During this
time Kant was striving to work out an independent position, but before
the 1770s his views remained fluid.
In 1766 Kant published his first work concerned with the possibility of
metaphysics, which later became a central topic of his mature
philosophy. Dreams of a Spirit-Seer Elucidated by Dreams of
Metaphysics, which he wrote soon after publishing a short Essay on
Maladies of the Mind (1764), was occasioned by Kant’s fascination with
the Swedish visionary Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772), who claimed to
have insight into a spirit world that enabled him to make a series of
apparently miraculous predictions. In this curious work Kant
satirically compares Swedenborg’s spirit-visions to the belief of
rationalist metaphysicians in an immaterial soul that survives death,
and he concludes that philosophical knowledge of either is impossible
because human reason is limited to experience. The skeptical tone of
Dreams is tempered, however, by Kant’s suggestion that “moral faith”
nevertheless supports belief in an immaterial and immortal soul, even
if it is not possible to attain metaphysical knowledge in this domain
(2:373).
In 1770, at the age of forty-six, Kant was appointed to the chair in
logic and metaphysics at the Albertina, after teaching for fifteen
years as an unsalaried lecturer and working since 1766 as a
sublibrarian to supplement his income. Kant was turned down for the
same position in 1758. But later, as his reputation grew, he declined
chairs in philosophy at Erlangen (1769) and Jena (1770) in hopes of
obtaining one in Königsberg. After Kant was finally promoted, he
gradually extended his repertoire of lectures to include anthropology
(Kant’s was the first such course in Germany and became very popular),
rational theology, pedagogy, natural right, and even mineralogy and
military fortifications. In order to inaugurate his new position, Kant
also wrote one more Latin dissertation: Concerning the Form and
Principles of the Sensible and Intelligible World (1770), which is
known as the Inaugural Dissertation.
The Inaugural Dissertation departs more radically from both Wolffian
rationalism and British sentimentalism than Kant’s earlier work.
Inspired by Crusius and the Swiss natural philosopher Johann Heinrich
Lambert (1728–1777), Kant distinguishes between two fundamental
powers of cognition, sensibility and understanding (intelligence),
where the Leibniz-Wolffians regarded understanding (intellect) as the
only fundamental power. Kant therefore rejects the rationalist view
that sensibility is only a confused species of intellectual cognition,
and he replaces this with his own view that sensibility is distinct
from understanding and brings to perception its own subjective forms
of space and time – a view that developed out of Kant’s earlier
criticism of Leibniz’s relational view of space in Concerning the
Ultimate Ground of the Differentiation of Directions in Space (1768).
Moreover, as the title of the Inaugural Dissertation indicates, Kant
argues that sensibility and understanding are directed at two
different worlds: sensibility gives us access to the sensible world,
while understanding enables us to grasp a distinct intelligible
world. These two worlds are related in that what the understanding
grasps in the intelligible world is the “paradigm” of
“NOUMENAL PERFECTION,” which is “a common measure
for all other things in so far as they are realities.”
Considered theoretically, this intelligible paradigm of perfection is
God; considered practically, it is “MORAL PERFECTION”
(2:396). The Inaugural Dissertation thus develops a form of Platonism;
and it rejects the view of British sentimentalists that moral
judgments are based on feelings of pleasure or pain, since Kant now
holds that moral judgments are based on pure understanding alone.
After 1770 Kant never surrendered the views that sensibility and
understanding are distinct powers of cognition, that space and time are
subjective forms of human sensibility, and that moral judgments are
based on pure understanding (or reason) alone. But his embrace of
Platonism in the Inaugural Dissertation was short-lived. He soon denied
that our understanding is capable of insight into an intelligible
world, which cleared the path toward his mature position in the
Critique of Pure Reason (1781), according to which the understanding
(like sensibility) supplies forms that structure our experience of the
sensible world, to which human knowledge is limited, while the
intelligible (or noumenal) world is strictly unknowable to us. Kant
spent a decade working on the Critique of Pure Reason and published
nothing else of significance between 1770 and 1781. But its publication
marked the beginning of another burst of activity that produced Kant’s
most important and enduring works. Because early reviews of the
Critique of Pure Reason were few and (in Kant’s judgment)
uncomprehending, he tried to clarify its main points in the much
shorter Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics That Will Be Able to Come
Forward as a Science (1783). Among the major books that rapidly
followed are the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals (1785), Kant’s
main work on the fundamental principle of morality; the Metaphysical
Foundations of Natural Science (1786), his main work on natural
philosophy in what scholars call his critical period (1781–1798); the
second and substantially revised edition of the Critique of Pure Reason
(1787); the Critique of Practical Reason (1788), a fuller discussion of
topics in moral philosophy that builds on (and in some ways revises)
the Groundwork; and the Critique of the Power of Judgment (1790), which
deals with aesthetics and teleology. Kant also published a number of
important essays in this period, including Idea for a Universal History
With a Cosmopolitan Aim (1784) and Conjectural Beginning of Human
History (1786), his main contributions to the philosophy of history; An
Answer to the Question: What is Enlightenment? (1784), which broaches
some of the key ideas of his later political essays; and What Does it
Mean to Orient Oneself in Thinking? (1786), Kant’s intervention in the
pantheism controversy that raged in German intellectual circles after
F. H. Jacobi (1743–1819) accused the recently deceased G. E. Lessing
(1729–1781) of Spinozism.
With these works Kant secured international fame and came to dominate
German philosophy in the late 1780s. But in 1790 he announced that the
Critique of the Power of Judgment brought his critical enterprise to an
end (5:170). By then K. L. Reinhold (1758–1823), whose Letters on the
Kantian Philosophy (1786) popularized Kant’s moral and religious ideas,
had been installed (in 1787) in a chair devoted to Kantian philosophy
at Jena, which was more centrally located than Königsberg and
rapidly developing into the focal point of the next phase in German
intellectual history. Reinhold soon began to criticize and move away
from Kant’s views. In 1794 his chair at Jena passed to J. G. Fichte,
who had visited the master in Königsberg and whose first book,
Attempt at a Critique of All Revelation (1792), was published
anonymously and initially mistaken for a work by Kant himself. This
catapulted Fichte to fame, but soon he too moved away from Kant and
developed an original position quite at odds with Kant’s, which Kant
finally repudiated publicly in 1799 (12:370–371). Yet while German
philosophy moved on to assess and respond to Kant’s legacy, Kant
himself continued publishing important works in the 1790s. Among these
are Religion Within the Boundaries of Mere Reason (1793), which drew a
censure from the Prussian King when Kant published the book after its
second essay was rejected by the censor; The Conflict of the Faculties
(1798), a collection of essays inspired by Kant’s troubles with the
censor and dealing with the relationship between the philosophical and
theological faculties of the university; On the Common Saying: That May
be Correct in Theory, But it is of No Use in Practice (1793), Toward
Perpetual Peace (1795), and the Doctrine of Right, the first part of
The Metaphysics of Morals (1797), Kant’s main works in political
philosophy; the Doctrine of Virtue, the second part of The Metaphysics
of Morals (1797), Kant’s most mature work in moral philosophy, which he had been planning for
more than thirty years; and Anthropology From a Pragmatic Point of View
(1798), based on Kant’s anthropology lectures. Several other
compilations of Kant’s lecture notes from other courses were published
later, but these were not prepared by Kant himself.
Kant retired from teaching in 1796. For nearly two decades he had lived
a highly disciplined life focused primarily on completing his
philosophical system, which began to take definite shape in his mind
only in middle age. After retiring he came to believe that there was a
gap in this system separating the metaphysical foundations of natural
science from physics itself, and he set out to close this gap in a
series of notes that postulate the existence of an ether or caloric
matter. These notes, known as the Opus Postumum, remained unfinished
and unpublished in Kant’s lifetime, and scholars disagree on their
significance and relation to his earlier work. It is clear, however,
that some of these late notes show unmistakable signs of Kant’s mental decline,
which became tragically precipitous around 1800. Kant died February 12,
1804, just short of his eightieth birthday.
The main topic of the Critique of Pure Reason is the possibility of
metaphysics, understood in a specific way. Kant defines metaphysics in
terms of “the cognitions after which reason might strive
independently of all experience,” and his goal in the book is to
reach a “decision about the possibility or impossibility of a
metaphysics in general, and the determination of its sources, as well
as its extent and boundaries, all, however, from principles”
(Axii. See also Bxiv; and 4:255–257). Thus metaphysics for Kant
concerns a priori knowledge, or knowledge whose justification does not
depend on experience; and he associates a priori knowledge with reason.
The project of the Critique is to examine whether, how, and to what
extent human reason is capable of a priori knowledge.
To understand the project of the Critique better, let us consider
the historical and intellectual context in which it was
written.[5] 
 Kant wrote the
Critique toward the end of the Enlightenment, which was then in a state
of crisis. Hindsight enables us to see that the 1780’s was a
transitional decade in which the cultural balance shifted decisively
away from the Enlightenment toward Romanticism, but Kant did
not have the benefit of such hindsight.
The Enlightenment was a reaction to the rise and successes of modern
science in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The spectacular
achievements of Newton in particular engendered widespread confidence
and optimism about the power of human reason to control nature and to
improve human life. One effect of this new confidence in reason was
that traditional authorities were increasingly questioned. Why
should we need political or religious authorities to tell us how to
live or what to believe, if each of us has the capacity to figure these
things out for ourselves? Kant expresses this Enlightenment commitment
to the sovereignty of reason in the Critique:
Enlightenment is about thinking for oneself rather than letting others
think for you, according to What is Enlightenment? (8:35). In this
essay, Kant also expresses the Enlightenment faith in the inevitability
of progress. A few independent thinkers will gradually inspire a
broader cultural movement, which ultimately will lead to greater
freedom of action and governmental reform. A culture of enlightenment
is “almost inevitable” if only there is “freedom to make public use of
one’s reason in all matters” (8:36).
The problem is that to some it seemed unclear whether progress would in
fact ensue if reason enjoyed full sovereignty over traditional
authorities; or whether unaided reasoning would instead lead straight
to materialism, fatalism, atheism, skepticism (Bxxxiv), or even
libertinism and authoritarianism (8:146). The Enlightenment commitment
to the sovereignty of reason was tied to the expectation that it would
not lead to any of these consequences but instead would support certain
key beliefs that tradition had always sanctioned. Crucially, these
included belief in God, the soul, freedom, and the compatibility of
science with morality and religion. Although a few intellectuals
rejected some or all of these beliefs, the general spirit of the
Enlightenment was not so radical. The Enlightenment was about replacing
traditional authorities with the authority of individual human reason,
but it was not about overturning traditional moral and religious
beliefs.
Yet the original inspiration for the Enlightenment was the new physics,
which was mechanistic. If nature is entirely governed by mechanistic,
causal laws, then it may seem that there is no room for freedom, a
soul, or anything but matter in motion. This threatened the traditional
view that morality requires freedom. We must be free in order to choose
what is right over what is wrong, because otherwise we cannot be held
responsible. It also threatened the traditional religious belief in a
soul that can survive death or be resurrected in an afterlife. So
modern science, the pride of the Enlightenment, the source of its
optimism about the powers of human reason, threatened to undermine
traditional moral and religious beliefs that free rational thought was
expected to support. This was the main intellectual crisis of the
Enlightenment.
The Critique of Pure Reason is Kant’s response to this crisis. Its main
topic is metaphysics because, for Kant, metaphysics is the domain of
reason – it is “the inventory of all we possess through pure
reason, ordered systematically” (Axx) – and the authority of
reason was in question. Kant’s main goal is to show that a critique of
reason by reason itself, unaided and unrestrained by traditional
authorities, establishes a secure and consistent basis for both
Newtonian science and traditional morality and religion. In other
words, free rational inquiry adequately supports all of these essential
human interests and shows them to be mutually consistent. So reason
deserves the sovereignty attributed to it by the Enlightenment.
To see how Kant attempts to achieve this goal in the Critique, it
helps to reflect on his grounds for rejecting the Platonism of the
Inaugural Dissertation. The Inaugural Dissertation also tries
to reconcile Newtonian science with traditional morality and religion in a way,
but its strategy is different from that of the Critique. According to
the Inaugural Dissertation, Newtonian science is true of the sensible
world, to which sensibility gives us access; and the understanding
grasps principles of divine and moral perfection in a distinct
intelligible world, which are paradigms for measuring everything in the
sensible world. So on this view our knowledge of the intelligible world
is a priori because it does not depend on sensibility, and this a
priori knowledge furnishes principles for judging the sensible world
because in some way the sensible world itself conforms to or imitates
the intelligible world.
Soon after writing the Inaugural Dissertation, however, Kant expressed
doubts about this view. As he explained in a February 21, 1772 letter
to his friend and former student, Marcus Herz:
Here Kant entertains doubts about how a priori knowledge of an
intelligible world would be possible. The position of the Inaugural
Dissertation is that the intelligible world is independent of the human
understanding and of the sensible world, both of which (in different
ways) conform to the intelligible world. But, leaving aside questions
about what it means for the sensible world to conform to an
intelligible world, how is it possible for the human understanding to
conform to or grasp an intelligible world? If the intelligible world is
independent of our understanding, then it seems that we could grasp it
only if we are passively affected by it in some way. But for Kant
sensibility is our passive or receptive capacity to be affected by
objects that are independent of us (2:392, A51/B75). So the only way we
could grasp an intelligible world that is independent of us is through
sensibility, which means that our knowledge of it could not be a
priori. The pure understanding alone could at best enable us to form
representations of an intelligible world. But since these intellectual
representations would entirely “depend on our inner activity,” as Kant
says to Herz, we have no good reason to believe that they would conform to an
independent intelligible world. Such a priori intellectual
representations could well be figments of the brain that do not
correspond to anything independent of the human mind. In any case, it
is completely mysterious how there might come to be a correspondence
between purely intellectual representations and an independent
intelligible world.
Kant’s strategy in the Critique is similar to that of the Inaugural
Dissertation in that both works attempt to reconcile modern science
with traditional morality and religion by relegating them to distinct
sensible and intelligible worlds, respectively. But the Critique gives
a far more modest and yet revolutionary account of a priori knowledge.
As Kant’s letter to Herz suggests, the main problem with his view in
the Inaugural Dissertation is that it tries to explain the possibility
of a priori knowledge about a world that is entirely independent of the
human mind. This turned out to be a dead end, and Kant never again
maintained that we can have a priori knowledge about an intelligible
world precisely because such a world would be entirely independent of
us. However, Kant’s revolutionary position in the Critique is that we
can have a priori knowledge about the general structure of the sensible
world because it is not entirely independent of the human mind. The
sensible world, or the world of appearances, is constructed by the
human mind from a combination of sensory matter that we receive
passively and a priori forms that are supplied by our cognitive
faculties. We can have a priori knowledge only about aspects of the
sensible world that reflect the a priori forms supplied by our
cognitive faculties. In Kant’s words, “we can cognize of things a
priori only what we ourselves have put into them” (Bxviii). So
according to the Critique, a priori knowledge is possible only if and
to the extent that the sensible world itself depends on the way the
human mind structures its experience.
Kant characterizes this new constructivist view of experience in the
Critique through an analogy with the revolution wrought by Copernicus
in astronomy:
As this passage suggests, what Kant has changed in the Critique is
primarily his view about the role and powers of the understanding,
since he already held in the Inaugural Dissertation that sensibility
contributes the forms of space and time – which he calls pure (or a
priori) intuitions (2:397) – to our cognition of the sensible world.
But the Critique claims that pure understanding too, rather than giving
us insight into an intelligible world, is limited to providing forms –
which he calls pure or a priori concepts – that structure our cognition
of the sensible world. So now both sensibility and understanding work
together to construct cognition of the sensible world, which therefore
conforms to the a priori forms that are supplied by our cognitive
faculties: the a priori intuitions of sensibility and the a priori
concepts of the understanding. This account is analogous to the
heliocentric revolution of Copernicus in astronomy because both require
contributions from the observer to be factored into explanations of
phenomena, although neither reduces phenomena to the contributions of
observers
 alone.[6]
 The way celestial
phenomena appear to us on earth, according to Copernicus, is affected
by both the motions of celestial bodies and the motion of the earth,
which is not a stationary body around which everything else revolves.
For Kant, analogously, the phenomena of human experience depend on both
the sensory data that we receive passively through sensibility and the
way our mind actively processes this data according to its own a priori
rules. These rules supply the general framework in which the sensible
world and all the objects (or phenomena) in it appear to us. So the
sensible world and its phenomena are not entirely independent of the
human mind, which contributes its basic structure.
How does Kant’s Copernican revolution in philosophy improve on the
strategy of the Inaugural Dissertation for reconciling modern science
with traditional morality and religion? First, it gives Kant a new and
ingenious way of placing modern science on an a priori foundation. He
is now in a position to argue that we can have a priori knowledge about
the basic laws of modern science because those laws reflect the human
mind’s contribution to structuring our experience. In other words, the
sensible world necessarily conforms to certain fundamental laws – such
as that every event has a cause – because the human mind constructs it
according to those laws. Moreover, we can identify those laws by
reflecting on the conditions of possible experience, which reveals that
it would be impossible for us to experience a world in which, for
example, any given event fails to have a cause. From this Kant
concludes that metaphysics is indeed possible in the sense that we can
have a priori knowledge that the entire sensible world – not just our
actual experience, but any possible human experience – necessarily
conforms to certain laws. Kant calls this immanent metaphysics or the
metaphysics of experience, because it deals with the essential
principles that are immanent to human experience.
But, second, if “we can cognize of things a priori only what we
ourselves have put into them,” then we cannot have a priori
knowledge about things whose existence and nature are entirely
independent of the human mind, which Kant calls things in themselves
(Bxviii). In his words: “[F]rom this deduction of our faculty of
cognizing a priori […] there emerges a very strange result […],
namely that with this faculty we can never get beyond the boundaries
of possible experience, […and] that such cognition reaches
appearances only, leaving the thing in itself as something actual for
itself but uncognized by us” (Bxix–xx). That is, Kant’s
constructivist foundation for scientific knowledge restricts science
to the realm of appearances and implies that transcendent metaphysics
– i.e., a priori knowledge of things in themselves that transcend
possible human experience – is impossible. In the Critique
Kant thus rejects the insight into an intelligible world that he
defended in the Inaugural Dissertation, and he now claims that
rejecting knowledge about things in themselves is necessary for
reconciling science with traditional morality and religion. This is
because he claims that belief in God, freedom, and immortality have a
strictly moral basis, and yet adopting these beliefs on moral grounds
would be unjustified if we could know that they were
false. “Thus,” Kant says, “I had to deny knowledge
in order to make room for faith” (Bxxx). Restricting knowledge
to appearances and relegating God and the soul to an unknowable realm
of things in themselves guarantees that it is impossible to disprove
claims about God and the freedom or immortality of the soul, which
moral arguments may therefore justify us in believing. Moreover, the
determinism of modern science no longer threatens the freedom required
by traditional morality, because science and therefore determinism
apply only to appearances, and there is room for freedom in the realm
of things in themselves, where the self or soul is located. We cannot
know (theoretically) that we are free, because we cannot know anything
about things in themselves. But there are especially strong moral
grounds for the belief in human freedom, which acts as “the
keystone” supporting other morally grounded beliefs
(5:3–4). In this way, Kant replaces transcendent metaphysics
with a new practical science that he calls the metaphysics of
morals. It thus turns out that two kinds of metaphysics are possible:
the metaphysics of experience (or nature) and the metaphysics of
morals, both of which depend on Kant’s Copernican revolution in
philosophy.
Perhaps the central and most controversial thesis of the Critique of
Pure Reason is that human beings experience only appearances, not
things in themselves; and that space and time are only subjective forms
of human intuition that would not subsist in themselves if one were to
abstract from all subjective conditions of human intuition. Kant calls
this thesis transcendental
 idealism.[7]
One of his best summaries of it is arguably the following:
Kant introduces transcendental idealism in the part of the Critique
called the Transcendental Aesthetic, and scholars generally agree that
for Kant transcendental idealism encompasses at least the following
claims:
But scholars disagree widely on how to interpret these claims, and
there is no such thing as the standard interpretation of Kant’s
transcendental idealism. Two general types of interpretation have been
especially influential, however. This section provides an overview of
these two interpretations, although it should be emphasized that much
important scholarship on transcendental idealism does not fall neatly
into either of these two camps.
The two-objects reading is the traditional interpretation of Kant’s
transcendental idealism. It goes back to the earliest review of the
Critique – the so-called Göttingen review by Christian Garve
(1742–1798) and J. G. Feder
 (1740–1821)[9] –
 and it was the
dominant way of interpreting Kant’s transcendental idealism during his
own lifetime. It has been a live interpretive option since then and
remains so today, although it no longer enjoys the dominance that it
once
 did.[10]
According to the two-objects interpretation, transcendental idealism is
essentially a metaphysical thesis that distinguishes between two
classes of objects: appearances and things in themselves. Another name
for this view is the two-worlds interpretation, since it can also be
expressed by saying that transcendental idealism essentially
distinguishes between a world of appearances and another world of
things in themselves.
Things in themselves, on this interpretation, are absolutely real in
the sense that they would exist and have whatever properties they have
even if no human beings were around to perceive them. Appearances, on
the other hand, are not absolutely real in that sense, because their
existence and properties depend on human perceivers. Moreover, whenever
appearances do exist, in some sense they exist in the mind of human
perceivers. So appearances are mental entities or mental
representations. This, coupled with the claim that we experience only
appearances, makes transcendental idealism a form of phenomenalism on
this interpretation, because it reduces the objects of experience to
mental representations. All of our experiences – all of our
perceptions of objects and events in space, even those objects and
events themselves, and all non-spatial but still temporal thoughts and
feelings – fall into the class of appearances that exist in the
mind of human perceivers. These appearances cut us off entirely from
the reality of things in themselves, which are non-spatial and
non-temporal. Yet Kant’s theory, on this interpretation, nevertheless
requires that things in themselves exist, because they must transmit to
us the sensory data from which we construct appearances. In principle
we cannot know how things in themselves affect our senses, because our
experience and knowledge is limited to the world of appearances
constructed by and in the mind. Things in themselves are therefore a
sort of theoretical posit, whose existence and role are required by the
theory but are not directly verifiable.
The main problems with the two-objects interpretation are
philosophical. Most readers of Kant who have interpreted his
transcendental idealism in this way have been – often very
– critical of it, for reasons such as the following:
First, at best Kant is walking a fine line in claiming on the one hand
that we can have no knowledge about things in themselves, but on the
other hand that we know that things in themselves exist, that they
affect our senses, and that they are non-spatial and non-temporal. At
worst his theory depends on contradictory claims about what we can and
cannot know about things in themselves. This objection was
influentially articulated by Jacobi, when he complained that
“without that presupposition [of things in themselves] I could
not enter into the system, but with it I could not stay within
it” (Jacobi 1787, 336).
Second, even if that problem is surmounted, it has seemed to many that
Kant’s theory, interpreted in this way, implies a radical form of
skepticism that traps each of us within the contents of our own mind
and cuts us off from reality. Some versions of this objection proceed
from premises that Kant rejects. One version maintains that things in
themselves are real while appearances are not, and hence that on Kant’s
view we cannot have experience or knowledge of reality. But Kant denies
that appearances are unreal: they are just as real as things in
themselves but are in a different metaphysical class. Another version
claims that truth always involves a correspondence between mental
representations and things in themselves, from which it would follow
that on Kant’s view it is impossible for us to have true beliefs about
the world. But just as Kant denies that things in themselves are the
only (or privileged) reality, he also denies that correspondence with
things in themselves is the only kind of truth. Empirical judgments are
true just in case they correspond with their empirical objects in
accordance with the a priori principles that structure all possible
human experience. But the fact that Kant can appeal in this way to an
objective criterion of empirical truth that is internal to our
experience has not been enough to convince some critics that Kant is
innocent of an unacceptable form of skepticism, mainly because of his
insistence on our irreparable ignorance about things in themselves.
Third and finally, Kant’s denial that things in themselves are spatial
or temporal has struck many of his readers as incoherent. The role of
things in themselves, on the two-object interpretation, is to affect
our senses and thereby to provide the sensory data from which our
cognitive faculties construct appearances within the framework of our a
priori intuitions of space and time and a priori concepts such as
causality. But if there is no space, time, change, or causation in the
realm of things in themselves, then how can things in themselves affect
us? Transcendental affection seems to involve a causal relation between
things in themselves and our sensibility. If this is simply the way we
unavoidably think about transcendental affection, because we can give
positive content to this thought only by employing the concept of a
cause, while it is nevertheless strictly false that things in
themselves affect us causally, then it seems not only that we are
ignorant of how things in themselves really affect us. It seems,
rather, to be incoherent that things in themselves could affect us at
all if they are not in space or time.
The two-aspects reading attempts to interpret Kant’s transcendental
idealism in a way that enables it to be defended against at least some
of these objections. On this view, transcendental idealism does not
distinguish between two classes of objects but rather between two
different aspects of one and the same class of objects. For this reason
it is also called the one-world interpretation, since it holds that
there is only one world in Kant’s ontology, and that at least some
objects in that world have two different aspects: one aspect that
appears to us, and another aspect that does not appear to us. That is,
appearances are aspects of the same objects that also exist in
themselves. So, on this reading, appearances are not mental
representations, and transcendental idealism is not a form of
 phenomenalism.[11]
There are at least two main versions of the two-aspects theory. One
version treats transcendental idealism as a metaphysical theory
according to which objects have two aspects in the sense that they have
two sets of properties: one set of relational properties that appear to
us and are spatial and temporal, and another set of intrinsic
properties that do not appear to us and are not spatial or temporal
(Langton 1998). This property-dualist interpretation faces
epistemological objections similar to those faced by the two-objects
interpretation, because we are in no better position to acquire
knowledge about properties that do not appear to us than we are to
acquire knowledge about objects that do not appear to us. Moreover,
this interpretation also seems to imply that things in themselves are
spatial and temporal, since appearances have spatial and temporal
properties, and on this view appearances are the same objects as things
in themselves. But Kant explicitly denies that space and time are
properties of things in themselves.
A second version of the two-aspects theory departs more radically from
the traditional two-objects interpretation by denying that
transcendental idealism is at bottom a metaphysical theory. Instead, it
interprets transcendental idealism as a fundamentally epistemological
theory that distinguishes between two standpoints on the objects of
experience: the human standpoint, from which objects are viewed
relative to epistemic conditions that are peculiar to human cognitive
faculties (namely, the a priori forms of our sensible intuition); and
the standpoint of an intuitive intellect, from which the same objects
could be known in themselves and independently of any epistemic
conditions (Allison 2004). Human beings cannot really take up the
latter standpoint but can form only an empty concept of things as they
exist in themselves by abstracting from all the content of our
experience and leaving only the purely formal thought of an object in
general. So transcendental idealism, on this interpretation, is
essentially the thesis that we are limited to the human standpoint, and
the concept of a thing in itself plays the role of enabling us to chart
the boundaries of the human standpoint by stepping beyond them in
abstract (but empty) thought.
One criticism of this epistemological version of the two-aspects theory
is that it avoids the objections to other interpretations by
attributing to Kant a more limited project than the text of the
Critique warrants. There are passages that support this
 reading.[12] 
 But there are
also many passages in both editions of the Critique in which Kant
describes appearances as representations in the mind and in which his
distinction between appearances and things in themselves is given not
only epistemological but metaphysical
 significance.[13]
 It is unclear
whether all of these texts admit of a single, consistent
interpretation. 
The transcendental deduction is the central argument of the Critique
of Pure Reason and one of the most complex and difficult texts in the
history of philosophy. Given its complexity, there are naturally many
different ways of interpreting the
 deduction.[14] This
 brief
overview provides one perspective on some of its main ideas.
The transcendental deduction occurs in the part of the Critique called
the Analytic of Concepts, which deals with the a priori concepts that,
on Kant’s view, our understanding uses to construct experience together
with the a priori forms of our sensible intuition (space and time),
which he discussed in the Transcendental Aesthetic. Kant calls these a
priori concepts “categories,” and he argues elsewhere (in the so-called
metaphysical deduction) that they include such concepts as substance
and cause. The goal of the transcendental deduction is to show that we
have a priori concepts or categories that are objectively valid, or
that apply necessarily to all objects in the world that we experience.
To show this, Kant argues that the categories are necessary conditions
of experience, or that we could not have experience without the
categories. In Kant’s words:
 The transcendental deduction of all a priori concepts therefore has a
principle toward which the entire investigation must be directed,
namely this: that they must be recognized as a priori conditions of
the possibility of experiences (whether of the intuition that is
encountered in them, or of the thinking). Concepts that supply the
objective ground of the possibility of experience are necessary just
for that reason. (A93–94/B126)
The strategy Kant employs to argue that the categories are conditions
of experience is the main source of both the obscurity and the
ingenuity of the transcendental deduction. His strategy is to argue
that the categories are necessary specifically for self-consciousness,
for which Kant often uses the Leibnizian term “apperception.”
One way to approach Kant’s argument is to contrast his view of
self-consciousness with two alternative views that he rejects. Each of
these views, both Kant’s and those he rejects, can be seen as offering
competing answers the question: what is the source of our sense of an
ongoing and invariable self that persists throughout all the changes in
our experience?
The first answer to this question that Kant rejects is that
self-consciousness arises from some particular content being present in
each of one’s representations. This material conception of
self-consciousness, as we may call it, is suggested by
Locke’s account of personal identity. According to Locke, “it
being the same consciousness that makes a Man be himself to himself,
personal Identity depends on that only, whether it be annexed only to
one individual Substance, or can be continued in a succession of
several Substances” (Essay 2.27.10). What Locke calls “the same
consciousness” may be understood as some representational content that
is always present in my experience and that both identifies any
experience as mine and gives me a sense of a continuous self by virtue
of its continual presence in my experience. One problem with this view,
Kant believes, is that there is no such representational content that
is invariably present in experience, so the sense of an ongoing self
cannot possibly arise from that non-existent content (what Locke calls
“consciousness”) being present in each of one’s representations. In
Kant’s words, self-consciousness “does not yet come about by my
accompanying each representation with consciousness, but rather by my
adding one representation to the other and being conscious of their
synthesis. Therefore it is only because I can combine a manifold of
given representations in one consciousness that it is possible for me
to represent the identity of the consciousness in these
representations” (B133). Here Kant claims, against the Lockean
view, that self-consciousness arises from combining (or synthesizing)
representations with one another regardless of their content. In short,
Kant has a formal conception of self-consciousness rather than a
material one. Since no particular content of my experience is
invariable, self-consciousness must derive from my experience having an
invariable form or structure, and consciousness of the identity of
myself through all of my changing experiences must consist in awareness
of the formal unity and law-governed regularity of my experience. The
continuous form of my experience is the necessary correlate for my
sense of a continuous self.
There are at least two possible versions of the formal conception of
self-consciousness: a realist and an idealist version. On the realist
version, nature itself is law-governed and we become self-conscious by
attending to its law-governed regularities, which also makes this an
empiricist view of self-consciousness. The idea of an identical self
that persists throughout all of our experience, on this view, arises
from the law-governed regularity of nature, and our representations
exhibit order and regularity because reality itself is ordered and
regular. Kant rejects this realist view and embraces a conception of
self-consciousness that is both formal and idealist. According to Kant,
the formal structure of our experience, its unity and law-governed
regularity, is an achievement of our cognitive faculties rather than a
property of reality in itself. Our experience has a constant form
because our mind constructs experience in a law-governed way. So
self-consciousness, for Kant, consists in awareness of the mind’s
law-governed activity of synthesizing or combining sensible data to
construct a unified experience. As he expresses it, “this unity of
consciousness would be impossible if in the cognition of the manifold
the mind could not become conscious of the identity of the function by
means of which this manifold is synthetically combined into one
cognition” (A108).
Kant argues for this formal idealist conception of self-consciousness,
and against the formal realist view, on the grounds that “we can
represent nothing as combined in the object without having previously
combined it ourselves” (B130). In other words, even if reality in
itself were law-governed, its laws could not simply migrate over to our
mind or imprint themselves on us while our mind is entirely passive. We
must exercise an active capacity to represent the world as combined or
ordered in a law-governed way, because otherwise we could not represent
the world as law-governed even if it were law-governed in itself.
Moreover, this capacity to represent the world as law-governed must be
a priori because it is a condition of self-consciousness, and we would
already have to be self-conscious in order to learn from our experience
that there are law-governed regularities in the world. So it is
necessary for self-consciousness that we exercise an a priori capacity
to represent the world as law-governed. But this would also be
sufficient for self-consciousness if we could exercise our a priori
capacity to represent the world as law-governed even if reality in
itself were not law-governed. In that case, the realist and empiricist
conception of self-consciousness would be false, and the formal
idealist view would be true.
Kant’s confidence that no empiricist account could possibly explain
self-consciousness may be based on his assumption that the sense of
self each of us has, the thought of oneself as identical throughout all
of one’s changing experiences, involves necessity and universality,
which on his view are the hallmarks of the a priori. This assumption is
reflected in what we may call Kant’s principle of apperception: “The I
think must be able to accompany all my representations; for otherwise
something would be represented in me that could not be thought at all,
which is as much as to say that the representation would either be
impossible or else at least would be nothing for me”
 (B131–132).[15] 
 Notice the
claims about necessity and universality embodied in the words “must”
and “all” here. Kant is saying that for a representation to count as
mine, it must necessarily be accessible to conscious awareness in some
(perhaps indirect) way: I must be able to accompany it with “I
think….” All of my representations must be accessible to
consciousness in this way (but they need not actually be conscious),
because again that is simply what makes a representation count as mine.
Self-consciousness for Kant therefore involves a priori knowledge about
the necessary and universal truth expressed in this principle of
apperception, and a priori knowledge cannot be based on experience.
Kant may have developed this thread of his
argument in the transcendental deduction after reading Johann Nicolaus
Tetens (1736–1807) rather than through a direct encounter with
Locke’s texts (Tetens 1777, Kitcher 2011). On the subject of
self-consciousness, Tetens was a follower of Locke and also engaged
with Hume’s arguments for rejecting a continuing self. So Kant’s
actual opponents in the deduction may have been Lockean and Humean
positions as represented by Tetens, as well as rationalist views that
Kant would have encountered directly in texts by Leibniz, Wolff, and
some of their followers.
On the basis of this formal idealist conception of
self-consciousness, Kant’s argument (at least one central thread of it)
moves through two more conditions of self-consciousness in order to
establish the objective validity of the categories. The next condition
is that self-consciousness requires me to represent an objective world
distinct from my subjective representations – that is, distinct from my
thoughts about and sensations of that objective world. Kant uses this
connection between self-consciousness and objectivity to insert the
categories into his argument.
In order to be self-conscious, I cannot be wholly absorbed in the
contents of my perceptions but must distinguish myself from the rest of
the world. But if self-consciousness is an achievement of the mind,
then how does the mind achieve this sense that there is a distinction
between the I that perceives and the contents of its perceptions?
According to Kant, the mind achieves this sense by distinguishing
representations that necessarily belong together from representations
that are not necessarily connected but are merely associated in a
contingent way. Consider Kant’s example of the perception of a house
(B162). Imagine a house that is too large to fit into your visual field
from your vantage point near its front door. Now imagine that you walk
around the house, successively perceiving each of its sides. Eventually
you perceive the entire house, but not all at once, and you judge that
each of your representations of the sides of the house necessarily
belong together (as sides of one house) and that anyone who denied this
would be mistaken. But now imagine that you grew up in this house and
associate a feeling of nostalgia with it. You would not judge that
representations of this house are necessarily connected with feelings
of nostalgia. That is, you would not think that other people seeing the
house for the first time would be mistaken if they denied that it is
connected with nostalgia, because you recognize that this house is
connected with nostalgia for you but not necessarily for everyone. Yet
you distinguish this merely subjective connection from the objective
connection between sides of the house, which is objective because the
sides of the house necessarily belong together “in the object,” because
this connection holds for everyone universally, and because it is
possible to be mistaken about it. The point here is not that we must
successfully identify which representations necessarily belong together
and which are merely associated contingently, but rather that to be
self-conscious we must at least make this general distinction between
objective and merely subjective connections of representations.
At this point (at least in the second edition text) Kant introduces the
key claim that judgment is what enables us to distinguish objective
connections of representations that necessarily belong together from
merely subjective and contingent associations: “[A] judgment is nothing
other than the way to bring given cognitions to the objective unity of
apperception. That is the aim of the copula is in them: to distinguish
the objective unity of given representations from the subjective. For
this word designates the relation of the representations to the
original apperception and its necessary unity” (B141–142). Kant is
speaking here about the mental act of judging that results in the
formation of a judgment. Judging is an act of what Kant calls
synthesis, which he defines as “the action of putting different
representations together with each other and comprehending their
manifoldness in one cognition” (A77/B103). In other words, to
synthesize is in general to combine several representations into a
single (more) complex representation, and to judge is specifically to
combine concepts into a judgment – that is, to join a subject concept
to a predicate concept by means of the copula, as in “the body is
heavy” or “the house is four-sided.” Judgments need not be true, of
course, but they always have a truth value (true or false) because they
make claims to objective validity. When I say, by contrast, that “If I
carry a body, I feel a pressure of weight,” or that “if I see this
house, I feel nostalgia,” I am not making a judgment about the object
(the body or the house) but rather I am expressing a subjective
association that may apply only to me
 (B142).[16]
Kant’s reference to the necessary unity of apperception or
self-consciousness in the quotation above means (at least) that the
action of judging is the way our mind achieves self-consciousness. We
must represent an objective world in order to distinguish ourselves
from it, and we represent an objective world by judging that some
representations necessarily belong together. Moreover, recall from
 4.1
 that, for Kant, we must have an a priori capacity
to represent the world as law-governed, because “we can represent
nothing as combined (or connected) in the object without having
previously combined it ourselves” (B130). It follows that objective
connections in the world cannot simply imprint themselves on our mind.
Rather, experience of an objective world must be constructed by
exercising an a priori capacity to judge, which Kant calls the faculty
of understanding (A80–81/B106). The understanding constructs experience
by providing the a priori rules, or the framework of necessary laws, in
accordance with which we judge representations to be objective. These
rules are the pure concepts of the understanding or categories, which
are therefore conditions of self-consciousness, since they are rules
for judging about an objective world, and self-consciousness requires
that we distinguish ourselves from an objective world.
Kant identifies the categories in what he calls the metaphysical
deduction, which precedes the transcendental
 deduction.[17] Very
briefly, since the categories are a priori rules for judging, Kant
argues that an exhaustive table of categories can be derived from a
table of the basic logical forms of judgments. For example, according
to Kant the logical form of the judgment that “the body is heavy” would
be singular, affirmative, categorical, and assertoric. But since
categories are not mere logical functions but instead are rules for
making judgments about objects or an objective world, Kant arrives at
his table of categories by considering how each logical function would
structure judgments about objects (within our spatio-temporal forms of
intuition). For example, he claims that categorical judgments express a
logical relation between subject and predicate that corresponds to the
ontological relation between substance and accident; and the logical
form of a hypothetical judgment expresses a relation that corresponds
to cause and effect. Taken together with this argument, then, the
transcendental deduction argues that we become self-conscious by
representing an objective world of substances that interact according
to causal laws.
The final condition of self-consciousness that Kant adds to the
preceding conditions is that our understanding must cooperate with
sensibility to construct one, unbounded, and unified space-time to
which all of our representations may be related. 
To see why this further condition is required, consider that so far we
have seen why Kant holds that we must represent an objective world in
order to be self-conscious, but we could represent an objective world
even if it were not possible to relate all of our representations to
this objective world. For all that has been said so far, we might
still have unruly representations that we cannot relate in any way to
the objective framework of our experience. On Kant’s view, this would
be a problem because, as we have seen, he holds that
self-consciousness involves universality and necessity: according to
his principle of apperception, “the I think must be able to
accompany all my representations” (B131). Yet if, on the one
hand, I had representations that I could not relate in some way to an
objective world, then I could not accompany those representations with
“I think” or recognize them as my representations, because
I can say “I think…” about any given representation only
by relating it to an objective world, according to the argument just
discussed. So I must be able to relate any given representation to an
objective world in order for it to count as mine.  On the other hand,
self-consciousness would also be impossible if I represented multiple
objective worlds, even if I could relate all of my representations to
some objective world or other. In that case, I could not become
conscious of an identical self that has, say, representation 1 in
space-time A and representation 2 in space-time B. It may be possible
to imagine disjointed spaces and times, but it is not possible to
represent them as objectively real. So self-consciousness requires
that I can relate all of my representations to a single objective
world.
The reason why I must represent this one objective world by means of a
unified and unbounded space-time is that, as Kant argued in the
Transcendental Aesthetic, space and time are the pure forms of human
intuition. If we had different forms of intuition, then our experience
would still have to constitute a unified whole in order for us to be
self-conscious, but this would not be a spatio-temporal whole. Given
that space and time are our forms of intuition, however, our
understanding must still cooperate with sensibility to construct a
spatio-temporal whole of experience because, once again, “we can
represent nothing as combined in the object without having previously
combined it ourselves,” and “all combination […] is an action of the
understanding” (B130). So Kant distinguishes between space and time as
pure forms of intuition, which belong solely to sensibility; and the
formal intuitions of space and time (or space-time), which are unified
by the understanding (B160–161). These formal intuitions are the
spatio-temporal whole within which our understanding constructs
experience in accordance with the
 categories.[18]
The most important implication of Kant’s claim that the understanding
constructs a single whole of experience to which all of our
representations can be related is that, since he defines nature
“regarded materially” as “the sum total of all
appearances” and he has argued that the categories are
objectively valid of all possible appearances, on his view it follows
that our categories are the source of the fundamental laws of nature
“regarded formally” (B163, 165). So Kant concludes on this
basis that the understanding is the true law-giver of nature. In his
words: “all appearances in nature, as far as their combination
is concerned, stand under the categories, on which nature (considered
merely as nature in general) depends, as the original ground of its
necessary lawfulness (as nature regarded formally)” (B165). Or
more strongly: “we ourselves bring into the appearances that
order and regularity that we call nature, and moreover we would not be
able to find it there if we, or the nature of our mind, had not
originally put it there. […] The understanding is thus not merely a
faculty for making rules through the comparison of the appearances: it
is itself the legislation for nature, i.e., without understanding
there would not be any nature at all” (A125–126). 
Having examined two central parts of Kant’s positive project in
theoretical philosophy from the Critique of Pure Reason, transcendental
idealism and the transcendental deduction, let us now turn to his
practical philosophy in the Critique of Practical
 Reason.
 Since Kant’s
philosophy is deeply systematic, this section begins with a preliminary
look at how his theoretical and practical philosophy fit together (see
also section
 7).
The fundamental idea of Kant’s philosophy is human autonomy. So far
we have seen this in Kant’s constructivist view of experience,
according to which our understanding is the source of the general laws
of nature. “Autonomy” literally means giving the law to oneself, and on
Kant’s view our understanding provides laws that constitute the a
priori framework of our experience. Our understanding does not provide
the matter or content of our experience, but it does provide the basic
formal structure within which we experience any matter received through
our senses. Kant’s central argument for this view is the transcendental
deduction, according to which it is a condition of self-consciousness
that our understanding constructs experience in this way. So we may
call self-consciousness the highest principle of Kant’s theoretical
philosophy, since it is (at least) the basis for all of our a priori
knowledge about the structure of nature.
Kant’s moral philosophy is also based on the idea of autonomy. He holds
that there is a single fundamental principle of morality, on which all
specific moral duties are based. He calls this moral law (as it is
manifested to us) the categorical imperative (see
 5.4).
 The moral law is a product of reason, for Kant, while
the basic laws of nature are products of our understanding. There are
important differences between the senses in which we are autonomous in
constructing our experience and in morality. For example, Kant regards
understanding and reason as different cognitive faculties, although he
sometimes uses “reason” in a wide sense to cover
 both.[19] 
 The categories
and therefore the laws of nature are dependent on our specifically
human forms of intuition, while reason is not. The moral law does not
depend on any qualities that are peculiar to human nature but only on
the nature of reason as such, although its manifestation to us as a
categorical imperative (as a law of duty) reflects the fact that the
human will is not necessarily determined by pure reason but is also
influenced by other incentives rooted in our needs and inclinations;
and our specific duties deriving from the categorical imperative do
reflect human nature and the contingencies of human life. Despite these
differences, however, Kant holds that we give the moral law to
ourselves, as we also give the general laws of nature to
ourselves, though in a different sense. Moreover, we each necessarily give the same
moral law to ourselves, just as we each construct our experience in
accordance with the same categories. To summarize:
So both parts of Kant’s philosophy are about autonomously
constructing a world, but in different senses. In theoretical
philosophy, we use our categories and forms of intuition to construct a
world of experience or nature. In practical philosophy, we use the
moral law to construct the idea of a moral world or a realm of ends
that guides our conduct (4:433), and ultimately to transform the
natural world into the highest good. Finally, transcendental idealism
is the framework within which these two parts of Kant’s philosophy fit
together (20:311). Theoretical philosophy deals with appearances, to
which our knowledge is strictly limited; and practical philosophy deals
with things in themselves, although it does not give us knowledge about
things in themselves but only provides rational justification for
certain beliefs about them for practical purposes.
To understand Kant’s arguments that practical philosophy justifies
certain beliefs about things in themselves, it is necessary to see
them in the context of his criticism of German rationalist
metaphysics. The three traditional topics of Leibniz-Wolffian special
metaphysics were rational psychology, rational cosmology, and rational
theology, which dealt, respectively, with the human soul, the
world-whole, and God. In the part of the Critique of Pure Reason
called the Transcendental Dialectic, Kant argues against the
Leibniz-Wolffian view that human beings are capable of a priori
knowledge in each of these domains, and he claims that the errors of
Leibniz-Wolffian metaphysics are due to an illusion that has its seat
in the nature of human reason itself. According to Kant, human reason
necessarily produces ideas of the soul, the world-whole, and God; and
these ideas unavoidably produce the illusion that we have a priori
knowledge about transcendent objects corresponding to them. This is an
illusion, however, because in fact we are not capable of a priori
knowledge about any such transcendent objects. Nevertheless, Kant
attempts to show that these illusory ideas have a positive, practical
use. He thus reframes Leibniz-Wolffian special metaphysics as a
practical science that he calls the metaphysics of morals. On Kant’s
view, our ideas of the soul, the world-whole, and God provide the
content of morally justified beliefs about human immortality, human
freedom, and the existence of God, respectively; but they are not
proper objects of speculative
 knowledge.[20]
The most important belief about things in themselves that Kant
thinks only practical philosophy can justify concerns human freedom.
Freedom is important because, on Kant’s view, moral appraisal
presupposes that we are free in the sense that we have the ability to
do otherwise. To see why, consider Kant’s example of a man who commits
a theft (5:95ff.). Kant holds that in order for this man’s action to be
morally wrong, it must have been within his control in the sense that
it was within his power at the time not to have committed the theft. If
this was not within his control at the time, then, while it may be
useful to punish him in order to shape his behavior or to influence
others, it nevertheless would not be correct to say that his action was
morally wrong. Moral rightness and wrongness apply only to free agents
who control their actions and have it in their power, at the time of
their actions, either to act rightly or not. According to Kant, this is
just common sense.
On these grounds, Kant rejects a type of compatibilism that he calls
the “comparative concept of freedom” and associates with
Leibniz (5:96–97). (Note that Kant has a specific type of
compatibilism in mind, which I will refer to simply as
“compatibilism,” although there may be other types of
compatibilism that do not fit Kant’s characterization of that
view). On the compatibilist view, as Kant understands it, I am free
whenever the cause of my action is within me. So I am unfree only when
something external to me pushes or moves me, but I am free whenever
the proximate cause of my body’s movement is internal to me as an
“acting being” (5:96). If we distinguish between
involuntary convulsions and voluntary bodily movements, then on this
view free actions are just voluntary bodily movements. Kant ridicules
this view as a “wretched subterfuge” that tries to solve
an ancient philosophical problem “with a little quibbling about
words” (ibid.). This view, he says, assimilates human freedom to
“the freedom of a turnspit,” or a projectile in flight, or
the motion of a clock’s hands (5:96–97). The proximate causes of
these movements are internal to the turnspit, the projectile, and the
clock at the time of the movement. This cannot be sufficient for moral
responsibility.
Why not? The reason, Kant says, is ultimately that the causes of these
movements occur in time. Return to the theft example. A compatibilist
would say that the thief’s action is free because its proximate cause
is inside him, and because the theft was not an involuntary convulsion
but a voluntary action. The thief decided to commit the theft, and his
action flowed from this decision. According to Kant, however, if the
thief’s decision is a natural phenomenon that occurs in time, then it
must be the effect of some cause that occurred in a previous time. This
is an essential part of Kant’s Newtonian worldview and is grounded in
the a priori laws (specifically, the category of cause and effect) in
accordance with which our understanding constructs experience: every
event has a cause that begins in an earlier time. If that cause too was
an event occurring in time, then it must also have a cause beginning in
a still earlier time, etc. All natural events occur in time and are
thoroughly determined by causal chains that stretch backwards into the
distant past. So there is no room for freedom in nature, which is
deterministic in a strong sense.
The root of the problem, for Kant, is time. Again, if the thief’s
choice to commit the theft is a natural event in time, then it is the
effect of a causal chain extending into the distant past. But the past
is out of his control now, in the present. Once the past is past, he
can’t change it. On Kant’s view, that is why his actions would not be
in his control in the present if they are determined by events in the
past. Even if he could control those past events in the past, he cannot
control them now. But in fact past events were not in his control in
the past either if they too were determined by events in the more
distant past, because eventually the causal antecedents of his action
stretch back before his birth, and obviously events that occurred
before his birth were never in his control. So if the thief’s choice to
commit the theft is a natural event in time, then it is not now and
never was in his control, and he could not have done otherwise than to
commit the theft. In that case, it would be a mistake to hold him
morally responsible for it.
Compatibilism, as Kant understands it, therefore locates the issue in
the wrong place. Even if the cause of my action is internal to me, if
it is in the past – for example, if my action today is
determined by a decision I made yesterday, or from the character I
developed in childhood – then it is not within my control
now. The real issue is not whether the cause of my action is internal
or external to me, but whether it is in my control now. For Kant,
however, the cause of my action can be within my control now only if
it is not in time. This is why Kant thinks that transcendental
idealism is the only way to make sense of the kind of freedom that
morality requires. Transcendental idealism allows that the cause
of my action may be a thing in itself outside of time: namely, my
noumenal self, which is free because it is not part of nature. No
matter what kind of character I have developed or what external
influences act on me, on Kant’s view all of my intentional, voluntary
actions are immediate effects of my noumenal self, which is causally
undetermined (5:97–98). My noumenal self is an uncaused cause
outside of time, which therefore is not subject to the deterministic
laws of nature in accordance with which our understanding constructs
experience.
Many puzzles arise on this picture that Kant does not resolve. For
example, if my understanding constructs all appearances in my
experience of nature, not only appearances of my own actions, then why
am I responsible only for my own actions but not for everything that
happens in the natural world? Moreover, if I am not alone in the world
but there are many noumenal selves acting freely and incorporating
their free actions into the experience they construct, then how do
multiple transcendentally free agents interact? How do you integrate my
free actions into the experience that your understanding
 constructs?[21]
 In spite of these
unsolved puzzles, Kant holds that we can make sense of moral appraisal
and responsibility only by thinking about human freedom in this way,
because it is the only way to prevent natural necessity from
undermining both.
Finally, since Kant invokes transcendental idealism to make sense
of freedom, interpreting his thinking about freedom leads us back to
disputes between the two-objects and two-aspects interpretations of
transcendental idealism. On the face of it, the two-objects
interpretation seems to make better sense of Kant’s view of
transcendental freedom than the two-aspects interpretation. If
morality requires that I am transcendentally free, then it seems that
my true self, and not just an aspect of my self, must be outside of
time, according to Kant’s argument. But applying the two-objects
interpretation to freedom raises problems of its own, since it
involves making a distinction between noumenal and phenomenal selves
that does not arise on the two-aspects view. If only my noumenal self
is free, and freedom is required for moral responsibility, then my
phenomenal self is not morally responsible. But how are my noumenal
and phenomenal selves related, and why is punishment inflicted on
phenomenal selves? It is unclear whether and to what extent appealing
to Kant’s theory of freedom can help to settle disputes about the
proper interpretation of transcendental idealism, since there are
serious questions about the coherence of Kant’s theory on either
interpretation.
Can we know that we are free in this transcendental sense? Kant’s
response is tricky. On the one hand, he distinguishes between
theoretical knowledge and morally justified belief
(A820–831/B848–859).  We do not have theoretical knowledge
that we are free or about anything beyond the limits of possible
experience, but we are morally justified in believing that we are free
in this sense. On the other hand, Kant also uses stronger language
than this when discussing freedom. For example, he says that
“among all the ideas of speculative reason freedom is the only
one the possibility of which we know a priori, though without having
any insight into it, because it is the condition of the moral law,
which we do know.” In a footnote to this passage, Kant explains
that we know freedom a priori because “were there no freedom,
the moral law would not be encountered at all in ourselves,” and
on Kant’s view everyone does encounter the moral law a priori
(5:4). For this reason, Kant claims that the moral law
“proves” the objective, “though only practical,
undoubted reality” of freedom (5:48–49). So Kant wants to
say that we do have knowledge of the reality of freedom, but that this
is practical knowledge of a practical reality, or cognition
“only for practical purposes,” by which he means to
distinguish it from theoretical knowledge based on experience or
reflection on the conditions of experience (5:133). Our practical
knowledge of freedom is based instead on the moral law. The difference
between Kant’s stronger and weaker language seems mainly to be that
his stronger language emphasizes that our belief or practical
knowledge about freedom is unshakeable and that it in turn provides
support for other morally grounded beliefs in God and the immortality
of the soul. 
Kant calls our consciousness of the moral law, our awareness that the
moral law binds us or has authority over us, the “fact of
reason” (5:31–32, 42–43, 47, 55). So, on his view,
the fact of reason is the practical basis for our belief or practical
knowledge that we are free.  Kant insists that this moral
consciousness is “undeniable,” “a priori,” and
“unavoidable” (5:32, 47, 55). Every human being has a
conscience, a common sense grasp of morality, and a firm conviction
that he or she is morally accountable. We may have different beliefs
about the source of morality’s authority – God, social
convention, human reason. We may arrive at different conclusions about
what morality requires in specific situations. And we may violate our
own sense of duty. But we all have a conscience, and an unshakeable
belief that morality applies to us. According to Kant, this belief
cannot and does not need to be justified or “proved by any
deduction” (5:47). It is just a ground-level fact about human
beings that we hold ourselves morally accountable. But Kant is making
a normative claim here as well: it is also a fact, which cannot and
does not need to be justified, that we are morally accountable, that
morality does have authority over us.  Kant holds that philosophy
should be in the business of defending this common sense moral belief,
and that in any case we could never prove or disprove it (4:459).
Kant may hold that the fact of reason, or our consciousness of moral
obligation, implies that we are free on the grounds that ought implies
can. In other words, Kant may believe that it follows from the fact
that we ought (morally) to do something that we can or are able to do
it. This is suggested, for example, by a passage in which Kant asks us
to imagine someone threatened by his prince with immediate execution
unless he “give[s] false testimony against an honorable man whom the
prince would like to destroy under a plausible pretext.” Kant says that
“[h]e would perhaps not venture to assert whether he would do it or
not, but he must admit without hesitation that it would be possible for
him. He judges, therefore, that he can do something because he is aware
that he ought to do it and cognizes freedom within him, which, without
the moral law, would have remained unknown to him” (5:30). This is a
hypothetical example of an action not yet carried out. It seems that
pangs of guilt about the immorality of an action that you carried out
in the past, on this reasoning, would imply more directly that you have
(or at least had) the ability to act otherwise than you did, and
therefore that you are free in Kant’s sense.
In both the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals and the Critique
of Practical Reason, Kant also gives a more detailed argument for the
conclusion that morality and freedom reciprocally imply one another,
which is sometimes called the reciprocity thesis (Allison 1990). On
this view, to act morally is to exercise freedom, and the only way to
fully exercise freedom is to act morally. Kant’s arguments for this
view differ in these texts, but the general structure of his argument
in the Critique of Practical Reason may be summarized as follows.
First, it follows from the basic idea of having a will that to act at
all is to act on some principle, or what Kant calls a maxim. A maxim
is a subjective rule or policy of action: it says what you are doing
and why. Kant gives as examples the maxims “to let no
insult pass unavenged” and “to increase my wealth by every
safe means” (5:19, 27).  We may be unaware of our maxims, we may
not act consistently on the same maxims, and our maxims may not be
consistent with one another. But Kant holds that since we are rational
beings our actions always aim at some sort of end or goal, which our
maxim expresses. The goal of an action may be something as basic as
gratifying a desire, or it may be something more complex such as
becoming a doctor or a lawyer. In any case, the causes of our actions
are never our desires or impulses, on Kant’s view. If I act to gratify
some desire, then I choose to act on a maxim that specifies the
gratification of that desire as the goal of my action. For example, if
I desire some coffee, then I may act on the maxim to go to a cafe and
buy some coffee in order to gratify that desire.
Second, Kant distinguishes between two basic kinds of principles or
rules that we can act on: what he calls material and formal principles.
To act in order to satisfy some desire, as when I act on the maxim to
go for coffee at a cafe, is to act on a material principle (5:21ff.).
Here the desire (for coffee) fixes the goal, which Kant calls the
object or matter of the action, and the principle says how to achieve
that goal (go to a cafe). Corresponding to material principles, on
Kant’s view, are what he calls hypothetical imperatives. A hypothetical
imperative is a principle of rationality that says I should act in
a certain way if I choose to satisfy some desire. If maxims in general
are rules that describe how one does act, then imperatives in general
prescribe how one should act. An imperative is hypothetical if it says
how I should act only if I choose to pursue some goal in order to
gratify a desire (5:20). This, for example, is a hypothetical
imperative: if you want coffee, then go to the cafe. This hypothetical
imperative applies to you only if you desire coffee and choose to
gratify that desire.
In contrast to material principles, formal principles describe how one
acts without making reference to any desires. This is easiest to
understand through the corresponding kind of imperative, which Kant
calls a categorical imperative. A categorical imperative commands
unconditionally that I should act in some way. So while hypothetical
imperatives apply to me only on the condition that I have and set the
goal of satisfying the desires that they tell me how to satisfy,
categorical imperatives apply to me no matter what my goals and desires
may be. Kant regards moral laws as categorical imperatives, which apply
to everyone unconditionally. For example, the moral requirement to help
others in need does not apply to me only if I desire to help others in
need, and the duty not to steal is not suspended if I have some desire
that I could satisfy by stealing. Moral laws do not have such
conditions but rather apply unconditionally. That is why they apply to
everyone in the same way.
Third, insofar as I act only on material principles or hypothetical
imperatives, I do not act freely, but rather I act only to satisfy some
desire(s) that I have, and what I desire is not ultimately within my
control. To some limited extent we are capable of rationally shaping
our desires, but insofar as we choose to act in order to satisfy
desires we are choosing to let nature govern us rather than governing
ourselves (5:118). We are always free in the sense that we always have
the capacity to govern ourselves rationally instead of letting our
desires set our ends for us. But we may (freely) fail to exercise that
capacity. Moreover, since Kant holds that desires never cause us to
act, but rather we always choose to act on a maxim even when that maxim
specifies the satisfaction of a desire as the goal of our action, it
also follows that we are always free in the sense that we freely choose
our maxims. Nevertheless, our actions are not free in the sense of
being autonomous if we choose to act only on material principles, because in
that case we do not give the law to ourselves, but instead we choose to
allow nature in us (our desires) to determine the law for our
actions.    
Finally, the only way to act freely in the full sense of exercising
autonomy is therefore to act on formal principles or categorical
imperatives, which is also to act morally. Kant does not mean that
acting autonomously requires that we take no account of our desires,
which would be impossible (5:25, 61). Rather, he holds that we
typically formulate maxims with a view to satisfying our desires, but
that “as soon as we draw up maxims of the will for
ourselves” we become immediately conscious of the moral law
(5:29). This immediate consciousness of the moral law takes the
following form:
In other words, to assess the moral permissibility of my maxim, I ask
whether everyone could act on it, or whether it could be willed as a universal
law. The issue is not whether it would be good if everyone acted on my
maxim, or whether I would like it, but only whether it would be
possible for my maxim to be willed as a universal law. This gets at the form, not
the matter or content, of the maxim. A maxim has morally permissible
form, for Kant, only if it could be willed as a universal law. If my maxim fails
this test, as this one does, then it is morally impermissible for me to
act on it.
If my maxim passes the universal law test, then it is morally
permissible for me to act on it, but I fully exercise my autonomy only
if my fundamental reason for acting on this maxim is that it is
morally permissible or required that I do so. Imagine that I am moved
by a feeling of sympathy to formulate the maxim to help someone in
need. In this case, my original reason for formulating this maxim is
that a certain feeling moved me. Such feelings are not entirely within
my control and may not be present when someone actually needs my
help. But this maxim passes Kant’s test: it could be willed as a
universal law that everyone help others in need from motives of
sympathy. So it would not be wrong to act on this maxim when the
feeling of sympathy so moves me.  But helping others in need would not
fully exercise my autonomy unless my fundamental reason for doing so
is not that I have some feeling or desire, but rather that it would be
right or at least permissible to do so. Only when such a purely formal
principle supplies the fundamental motive for my action do I act
autonomously.
So the moral law is a law of autonomy in the sense that “freedom
and unconditional practical law reciprocally imply each another”
(5:29).  Even when my maxims are originally suggested by my feelings
and desires, if I act only on morally permissible (or required) maxims
because they are morally permissible (or required), then my actions
will be autonomous. And the reverse is true as well: for Kant this is
the only way to act
 autonomously.[22]
Kant holds that reason unavoidably produces not only consciousness
of the moral law but also the idea of a world in which there is both
complete virtue and complete happiness, which he calls the highest
good. Our duty to promote the highest good, on Kant’s view, is the sum
of all moral duties, and we can fulfill this duty only if we believe
that the highest good is a possible state of affairs. Furthermore, we
can believe that the highest good is possible only if we also believe
in the immortality of the soul and the existence of God, according to
Kant. On this basis, he claims that it is morally necessary to believe
in the immortality of the soul and the existence of God, which he calls
postulates of pure practical reason. This section briefly outlines
Kant’s view of the highest good and his argument for these practical
postulates in the Critique of Practical Reason and other works.
In the previous section we saw that, on Kant’s view, the moral law is
a purely formal principle that commands us to act only on maxims that
have what he calls lawgiving form, which maxims have only if they can
be willed as universal laws. Moreover, our fundamental reason for
choosing to act on such maxims should be that they have this lawgiving
form, rather than that acting on them would achieve some end or goal
that would satisfy a desire (5:27). For example, I should help others
in need not, at bottom, because doing so would make me feel good, even
if it would, but rather because it is right; and it is right (or
permissible) to help others in need because this maxim can be willed
as a universal law.
Although Kant holds that the morality of an action depends on the
form of its maxim rather than its end or goal, he nevertheless claims
both that every human action has an end and that we are unavoidably
concerned with the consequences of our actions (4:437; 5:34; 6:5–7,
385). This is not a moral requirement but simply part of what it means
to be a rational being. Moreover, Kant also holds the stronger view
that it is an unavoidable feature of human reason that we form ideas
not only about the immediate and near-term consequences of our actions,
but also about ultimate consequences. This is the practical
manifestation of reason’s general demand for what Kant calls “the
unconditioned”
 (5:107–108).[23]
 In particular, since
we naturally have desires and inclinations, and our reason has “a
commission” to attend to the satisfaction of our desires and
inclinations, on Kant’s view we unavoidably form an idea of the maximal
satisfaction of all our inclinations and desires, which he calls
happiness (5:61, 22, 124). This idea is indeterminate, however, since
nobody can know “what he really wishes and wills” and thus what would
make him completely happy (4:418). We also form the idea of a moral
world or realm of ends, in which everyone acts only in accordance with
maxims that can be universal laws (A808/B836, 4:433ff.).
But neither of these ideas by itself expresses our unconditionally
complete end, as human reason demands in its practical use. A perfectly
moral world by itself would not constitute our “whole and complete good
[…] even in the judgment of an impartial reason,” because it is human
nature also to need happiness (5:110, 25). And happiness by itself
would not be unconditionally good, because moral virtue is a condition
of worthiness to be happy (5:111). So our unconditionally complete end
must combine both virtue and happiness. In Kant’s words, “virtue and
happiness together constitute possession of the highest good in a
person, and happiness distributed in exact proportion to morality (as
the worth of a person and his worthiness to be happy) constitutes the
highest good of a possible world” (5:110–111). It is this ideal world
combining complete virtue with complete happiness that Kant normally
has in mind when he discusses the highest good.
Kant says that we have a duty to promote the highest good, taken in
this sense (5:125). He does not mean, however, to be identifying some
new duty that is not derived from the moral law, in addition to all the
particular duties we have that are derived from the moral
 law.[24]
 For example, he
is not claiming that in addition to my duties to help others in need,
not to commit theft, etc., I also have the additional duty to represent
the highest good as the final end of all moral conduct, combined with
happiness, and to promote that end. Rather, as we have seen, Kant holds
that it is an unavoidable feature of human reasoning, instead of a
moral requirement, that we represent all particular duties as leading
toward the promotion of the highest good. So the duty to promote the
highest good is not a particular duty at all, but the sum of all our
duties derived from the moral law – it “does not increase the number of
morality’s duties but rather provides these with a special point of
reference for the unification of all ends” (6:5). Nor does Kant mean
that anyone has a duty to realize or actually bring about the highest
good through their own power, although his language sometimes suggests
this (5:113, 122). Rather, at least in his later works Kant claims that
only the common striving of an entire “ethical community” can actually
produce the highest good, and that the duty of individuals is to
promote (but not single-handedly produce) this end with all of their
strength by doing what the moral law commands (6:97–98,
 390–394).[25]
Finally, according to Kant we must conceive of the highest good as a
possible state of affairs in order to fulfill our duty to promote it.
Here Kant does not mean that we unavoidably represent the highest good
as possible, since his view is that we must represent it as possible
only if we are to fulfill our duty of promoting it, and yet we may fail at
doing our duty. Rather, we have a choice about whether to conceive of
the highest good as possible, to regard it as impossible, or to remain
noncommittal (5:144–145). But we can fulfill our duty of promoting the
highest good only by choosing to conceive of the highest good as
possible, because we cannot promote any end without believing that it
is possible to achieve that end (5:122). So fulfilling the sum of all
moral duties to promote the highest good requires believing that a
world of complete virtue and happiness is not simply “a phantom of the
mind” but could actually be realized (5:472).
Kant argues that we can comply with our duty to promote the highest
good only if we believe in the immortality of the soul and the
existence of God. This is because to comply with that duty we must
believe that the highest good is possible, and yet to believe that the
highest good is possible we must believe that the soul is immortal and
that God exists, according to
 Kant.[26]
Consider first Kant’s moral argument for belief in immortality. The
highest good, as we have seen, would be a world of complete morality
and happiness. But Kant holds that it is impossible for “a rational
being of the sensible world” to exhibit “complete conformity of
dispositions with the moral law,” which he calls “holiness,” because we
can never extirpate the propensity of our reason to give priority to
the incentives of inclination over the incentive of duty, which
propensity Kant calls radical evil (5:122, 6:37). Kant claims that
the moral law nevertheless requires holiness, however, and that it therefore
“can only be found in an endless progress toward that complete
conformity,” or progress that goes to infinity (5:122). This does not
mean that we can substitute endless progress toward complete conformity
with the moral law for holiness in the concept of the highest good, but
rather that we must represent that complete conformity as an infinite
progress toward the limit of holiness. Kant continues: “This endless
progress is, however, possible only on the presupposition of the
existence and personality of the same rational being continuing
endlessly (which is called the immortality of the soul). Hence the
highest good is practically possible only on the presupposition of the
immortality of the soul, so that this, as inseparable with the moral
law, is a postulate of pure practical reason” (ibid.). Kant’s idea is
not that we should imagine ourselves attaining holiness later although
we are not capable of it in this life. Rather, his view is that we must
represent holiness as continual progress toward complete conformity of
our dispositions with the moral law that begins in this life and
extends into infinity.
Kant’s moral argument for belief in God in the Critique of Practical
Reason may be summarized as follows. Kant holds that virtue and
happiness are not just combined but necessarily combined in the idea of
the highest good, because only possessing virtue makes one worthy of
happiness – a claim that Kant seems to regard as part of the content of
the moral law (4:393; 5:110, 124). But we can represent virtue and
happiness as necessarily combined only by representing virtue as the
efficient cause of happiness. This means that we must represent the
highest good not simply as a state of affairs in which everyone is both
happy and virtuous, but rather as one in which everyone is happy
because they are virtuous (5:113–114, 124). However, it is beyond the
power of human beings, both individually and collectively, to guarantee
that happiness results from virtue, and we do not know any law of
nature that guarantees this either. Therefore, we must conclude that
the highest good is impossible, unless we postulate “the existence of a
cause of nature, distinct from nature, which contains the ground of
this connection, namely the exact correspondence of happiness with
morality” (5:125). This cause of nature would have to be God since it
must have both understanding and will. Kant probably does not
conceive of God as the efficient cause of a happiness that is rewarded
in a future life to those who are virtuous in this one. Rather, his
view is probably that we represent our endless progress toward
holiness, beginning with this life and extending into infinity, as the
efficient cause of our happiness, which likewise begins in this life
and extends to a future one, in accordance with teleological laws that
God authors and causes to harmonize with efficient causes in nature
(A809–812/B837–840; 5:127–131, 447–450).
Both of these arguments are subjective in the sense that, rather than
attempting to show how the world must be constituted objectively in
order for the highest good to be possible, they purport to show only
how we must conceive of the highest good in order to be subjectively
capable both of representing it as possible and of fulfilling our duty
to promote it. But Kant also claims that both arguments have an
objective basis: first, in the sense that it cannot be proven
objectively either that immortality or God’s existence are impossible;
and, second, in the sense that both arguments proceed from a duty to
promote the highest good that is based not on the subjective character
of human reason but on the moral law, which is objectively valid for
all rational beings. So while it is not, strictly speaking, a duty to
believe in God or immortality, we must believe both in order to fulfill
our duty to promote the highest good, given the subjective character of
human reason.
To see why, consider what would happen if we did not believe in God or
immortality, according to Kant. In the Critique of Pure Reason, Kant
seems to say that this would leave us without any incentive to be
moral, and even that the moral law would be invalid without God and
immortality (A813/B841, A468/B496). But Kant later rejects this view
(8:139). His mature view is that our reason would be in conflict with
itself if we did not believe in God and immortality, because pure
practical reason would represent the moral law as authoritative for us
and so present us with an incentive that is sufficient to determine our
will; but pure theoretical (i.e., speculative) reason would undermine
this incentive by declaring morality an empty ideal, since it would not
be able to conceive of the highest good as possible (5:121, 143,
471–472, 450–453). In other words, the moral law would remain valid and
provide any rational being with sufficient incentive to act from duty,
but we would be incapable of acting as rational beings, since “it is a
condition of having reason at all […] that its principles and
affirmations must not contradict one another” (5:120). The only way to
bring speculative and practical reason “into that relation of equality
in which reason in general can be used purposively” is to affirm the
postulates on the grounds that pure practical reason has primacy over
speculative reason. This means, Kant explains, that if the capacity of
speculative reason “does not extend to establishing certain
propositions affirmatively, although they do not contradict it, as soon
as these same propositions belong inseparably to the practical interest
of pure reason it must accept them […,] being mindful, however, that
these are not its insights but are yet extensions of its use from
another, namely a practical perspective” (5:121). The primacy of
practical reason is a key element of Kant’s response to the crisis of
the Enlightenment, since he holds that reason deserves the sovereign
authority entrusted to it by the Enlightenment only on this basis.
This final section briefly discusses how Kant attempts to unify the
theoretical and practical parts of his philosophical system in the
Critique of the Power of Judgment.
In the Preface and Introduction to the Critique of the Power of
Judgment, Kant announces that his goal in the work is to “bring
[his] entire critical enterprise to an end” by bridging the
“gulf” or “chasm” that separates the domain of
his theoretical philosophy (discussed mainly in the Critique of Pure
Reason) from the domain of his practical philosophy (discussed mainly
in the Critique of Practical Reason) (5:170, 176, 195). In his words:
“The understanding legislates a priori for nature, as object of
the senses, for a theoretical cognition of it in a possible
experience. Reason legislates a priori for freedom and its own
causality, as the supersensible in the subject, for an unconditioned
practical cognition. The domain of the concept of nature under the one
legislation and that of the concept of freedom under the other are
entirely barred from any mutual influence that they could have on each
other by themselves (each in accordance with its fundamental laws) by
the great chasm that separates the supersensible from the
appearances” (5:195).
One way to understand the problem Kant is articulating here is to
consider it once again in terms of the crisis of the
 Enlightenment.[27]
 The crisis was that
modern science threatened to undermine traditional moral and religious
beliefs, and Kant’s response is to argue that in fact these essential
interests of humanity are consistent with one another when reason is
granted sovereignty and practical reason is given primacy over
speculative reason. But the transcendental idealist framework within
which Kant develops this response seems to purchase the consistency of
these interests at the price of sacrificing a unified view of the world
and our place in it. If science applies only to appearances, while
moral and religious beliefs refer to things in themselves or “the
supersensible,” then how can we integrate these into a single
conception of the world that enables us to transition from the one
domain to the other? Kant’s solution is to introduce a third a priori
cognitive faculty, which he calls the reflecting power of judgment,
that gives us a teleological perspective on the world. Reflecting
judgment provides the concept of teleology or purposiveness that
bridges the chasm between nature and freedom, and thus unifies the
theoretical and practical parts of Kant’s philosophy into a single
system (5:196–197).
It is important to Kant that a third faculty independent of both
understanding and reason provides this mediating perspective, because
he holds that we do not have adequate theoretical grounds for
attributing objective teleology to nature itself, and yet regarding
nature as teleological solely on moral grounds would only heighten the
disconnect between our scientific and moral ways of viewing the world.
Theoretical grounds do not justify us in attributing objective
teleology to nature, because it is not a condition of
self-consciousness that our understanding construct experience in
accordance with the concept of teleology, which is not among Kant’s
categories or the principles of pure understanding that ground the
fundamental laws of nature. That is why his theoretical philosophy
licenses us only in attributing mechanical causation to nature itself. To this limited extent, Kant is sympathetic to the dominant strain in modern
philosophy that banishes final causes from nature and instead treats
nature as nothing but matter in motion, which can be fully described
mathematically. But Kant wants somehow to reconcile this mechanistic
view of nature with a conception of human agency that is essentially
teleological. As we saw in the previous section, Kant holds that
every human action has an end and that the sum of all moral duties is
to promote the highest good. It is essential to Kant’s approach,
however, to maintain the autonomy of both understanding (in nature)
and reason (in morality), without allowing either to encroach on the
other’s domain, and yet to harmonize them in a single system. This
harmony can be orchestrated only from an independent standpoint, from
which we do not judge how nature is constituted objectively (that is
the job of understanding) or how the world ought to be (the job of
reason), but from which we merely regulate or reflect on our cognition
in a way that enables us to regard it as systematically unified.
According to Kant, this is the task of reflecting judgment, whose a
priori principle is to regard nature as purposive or teleological,
“but only as a regulative principle of the faculty of
cognition” (5:197).
In the Critique of the Power of Judgment, Kant discusses four main
ways in which reflecting judgment leads us to regard nature as
purposive: first, it leads us to regard nature as governed by a system
of empirical laws; second, it enables us to make aesthetic judgments;
third, it leads us to think of organisms as objectively purposive; and,
fourth, it ultimately leads us to think about the final end of nature
as a
 whole.[28]
First, reflecting judgment enables us to discover empirical laws of
nature by leading us to regard nature as if it were the product of
intelligent design (5:179–186). We do not need reflecting judgment to
grasp the a priori laws of nature based on our categories, such as that
every event has a cause. But in addition to these a priori laws nature
is also governed by particular, empirical laws, such as that fire
causes smoke, which we cannot know without consulting experience. To
discover these laws, we must form hypotheses and devise experiments on
the assumption that nature is governed by empirical laws that we can
grasp (Bxiii–xiv). Reflecting judgment makes this assumption through
its principle to regard nature as purposive for our understanding,
which leads us to treat nature as if its empirical laws were designed
to be understood by us (5:180–181). Since this principle only regulates
our cognition but is not constitutive of nature itself, this does not
amount to assuming that nature really is the product of intelligent
design, which according to Kant we are not justified in believing on
theoretical grounds. Rather, it amounts only to approaching nature in
the practice of science as if it were designed to be understood by us.
We are justified in doing this because it enables us to discover
empirical laws of nature. But it is only a regulative principle of
reflecting judgment, not genuine theoretical knowledge, that nature is
purposive in this way.
Second, Kant thinks that aesthetic judgments about both beauty and
sublimity involve a kind of purposiveness, and that the beauty of
nature in particular suggests to us that nature is hospitable to our
ends. According to his aesthetic theory, we judge objects to be
beautiful not because they gratify our desires, since aesthetic
judgments are disinterested, but rather because apprehending their form
stimulates what he calls the harmonious “free play” of our
understanding and imagination, in which we take a distinctively
aesthetic pleasure (5:204–207, 217–218, 287). So beauty is not a
property of objects, but a relation between their form and the way our
cognitive faculties work. Yet we make aesthetic judgments that claim
intersubjective validity because we assume that there is a common sense
that enables all human beings to communicate aesthetic feeling
(5:237–240, 293–296). Beautiful art is intentionally created to
stimulate this universally communicable aesthetic pleasure, although it
is effective only when it seems unintentional (5:305–307). Natural
beauty, however, is unintentional: landscapes do not know how to
stimulate the free play of our cognitive faculties, and they do not
have the goal of giving us aesthetic pleasure. In both cases, then,
beautiful objects appear purposive to us because they give us aesthetic
pleasure in the free play of our faculties, but they also do not appear
purposive because they either do not or do not seem to do this
intentionally. Kant calls this relation between our cognitive faculties
and the formal qualities of objects that we judge to be beautiful
“subjective purposiveness” (5:221). Although it is only subjective, the
purposiveness exhibited by natural beauty in particular may be
interpreted as a sign that nature is hospitable to our moral interests
(5:300). Moreover, Kant also interprets the experience of sublimity in
nature as involving purposiveness. But in this case it is not so much
the purposiveness of nature as our own purpose or “vocation” as moral
beings that we become aware of in the experience of the sublime, in which the
size and power of nature stand in vivid contrast to the superior
power of our reason (5:257–260, 267–269).
Third, Kant argues that reflecting judgment enables us to regard living
organisms as objectively purposive, but only as a regulative principle
that compensates for our inability to fully understand them mechanistically,
which reflects the limitations of our cognitive faculties rather than
any intrinsic teleology in nature. We cannot fully understand organisms
mechanistically because they are “self-organizing” beings, whose parts
are “combined into a whole by being reciprocally the cause and effect
of their form” (5:373–374). The parts of a watch are also possible only
through their relation to the whole, but that is because the watch is
designed and produced by some rational being. An organism, by contrast,
produces and sustains itself, which is inexplicable to us unless we
attribute to organisms purposes by analogy with human art (5:374–376).
But Kant claims that it is only a regulative principle of reflecting
judgment to regard organisms in this way, and that we are not justified
in attributing objective purposiveness to organisms themselves, since
it is only “because of the peculiar constitution of my cognitive
faculties [that] I cannot judge about the possibility of those things
and their generation except by thinking of a cause for these acts in
accordance with intentions” (5:397–398). Specifically, we cannot
understand how a whole can be the cause of its own parts because we
depend on sensible intuition for the content of our thoughts and
therefore must think the particular (intuition) first by subsuming it
under the general (a concept). To see that this is just a limitation of
the human, discursive intellect, imagine a being with an intuitive
understanding whose thought does not depend, as ours does, on receiving
sensory information passively, but rather creates the content of its
thought in the act of thinking it. Such a (divine) being could
understand how a whole can be the cause of its parts, since it could
grasp a whole immediately without first thinking particulars and then
combining them into a whole (5:401–410). Therefore, since we have a
discursive intellect and cannot know how things would appear to a being
with an intuitive intellect, and yet we can only think of organisms
teleologically, which excludes mechanism, Kant now says that we must
think of both mechanism and teleology only as regulative principles
that we need to explain nature, rather than as constitutive principles
that describe how nature is intrinsically constituted (5:410ff.).
Fourth, Kant concludes the Critique of the Power of Judgment with a
long appendix arguing that reflecting judgment supports morality by
leading us to think about the final end of nature, which we can only
understand in moral terms, and that conversely morality reinforces a
teleological conception of nature. Once it is granted on theoretical
grounds that we must understand certain parts of nature (organisms)
teleologically, although only as a regulative principle of reflecting
judgment, Kant says we may go further and regard the whole of nature as
a teleological system (5:380–381). But we can regard the whole of
nature as a teleological system only by employing the idea of God,
again only regulatively, as its intelligent designer. This involves
attributing what Kant calls external purposiveness to nature – that is,
attributing purposes to God in creating nature (5:425). What, then, is
God’s final end in creating nature? According to Kant, the final end of
nature must be human beings, but only as moral beings (5:435, 444–445).
This is because only human beings use reason to set and pursue ends,
using the rest of nature as means to their ends (5:426–427). Moreover,
Kant claims that human happiness cannot be the final end of nature,
because as we have seen he holds that happiness is not unconditionally
valuable (5:430–431). Rather, human life has value not because of what
we passively enjoy, but only because of what we actively do (5:434). We
can be fully active and autonomous, however, only by acting morally,
which implies that God created the world so that human beings could
exercise moral autonomy. Since we also need happiness, this too may be
admitted as a conditioned and consequent end, so that reflecting
judgment eventually leads us to the highest good (5:436). But
reflection on conditions of the possibility of the highest good leads
again to Kant’s moral argument for belief in God’s existence, which in turn reinforces the teleological
perspective on nature with which reflecting judgment began.
Thus Kant argues that although theoretical and practical philosophy
proceed from separate and irreducible starting points –
self-consciousness as the highest principle for our cognition of
nature, and the moral law as the basis for our knowledge of freedom –
reflecting judgment unifies them into a single, teleological worldview
that assigns preeminent value to human autonomy.
