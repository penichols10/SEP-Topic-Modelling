Sometimes we write or speak a sentence \(S\) that expresses nothing
either true or false, because some crucial information is missing
about what the words mean. If we go on to add this information, so
that \(S\) comes to express a true or false statement, we are said to
interpret \(S\), and the added information is called an
interpretation of \(S\). If the interpretation \(I\) happens
to make \(S\) state something true, we say that \(I\) is a
model of \(S\), or that \(I\) satisfies \(S\), in
symbols ‘\(I \vDash S\)’. Another way of saying that \(I\)
is a model of \(S\) is to say that \(S\) is true in \(I\),
and so we have the notion of model-theoretic truth, which is
truth in a particular interpretation. But one should remember that the
statement ‘\(S\) is true in \(I\)’ is just a paraphrase of
‘\(S\), when interpreted as in \(I\), is true’; so
model-theoretic truth is parasitic on plain ordinary truth, and we can
always paraphrase it away.
For example I might say
and offer the interpretation that ‘he’ is Alfonso
Arblaster of 35 The Crescent, Beetleford, and that ‘them’
are the pigeons in his loft. This interpretation explains (a) what
objects some expressions refer to, and (b) what classes some
quantifiers range over. (In this example there is one quantifier:
‘all of them’). Interpretations that consist of items (a)
and (b) appear very often in model theory, and they are known as
structures. Particular kinds of model theory use particular
kinds of structure; for example mathematical model theory tends to use
so-called first-order structures, model theory of modal
logics uses Kripke structures, and so on. 
The structure \(I\) in the previous paragraph involves one fixed
object and one fixed class. Since we described the structure today,
the class is the class of pigeons in Alfonso’s loft today, not
those that will come tomorrow to replace them. If Alfonso Arblaster
kills all the pigeons in his loft today, then \(I\) satisfies the
quoted sentence today but won’t satisfy it tomorrow, because
Alfonso can’t kill the same pigeons twice over. Depending on
what you want to use model theory for, you may be happy to evaluate
sentences today (the default time), or you may want to record how they
are satisfied at one time and not at another. In the latter case you
can relativise the notion of model and write ‘\(I \vDash_t
S\)’ to mean that \(I\) is a model of \(S\) at time \(t\). The
same applies to places, or to anything else that might be picked up by
other implicit indexical features in the sentence. For example if you
believe in possible worlds, you can index \(\vDash\) by the possible
world where the sentence is to be evaluated. Apart from using set
theory, model theory is completely agnostic about what kinds of thing
exist.
Note that the objects and classes in a structure carry labels that
steer them to the right expressions in the sentence. These labels are
an essential part of the structure.
If the same class is used to interpret all quantifiers, the class is
called the domain or universe of the structure. But
sometimes there are quantifiers ranging over different classes. For
example if I say
you will look for an interpretation that assigns a class of diseases
to ‘those thingummy diseases’ and a class of birds to
‘the birds’. Interpretations that give two or more classes
for different quantifiers to range over are said to be
many-sorted, and the classes are sometimes called the
sorts. 
The ideas above can still be useful if we start with a sentence \(S\)
that does say something either true or false without needing further
interpretation. (Model theorists say that such a sentence is fully
interpreted.) For example we can consider
misinterpretations \(I\) of a fully interpreted sentence
\(S\). A misinterpretation of \(S\) that makes it true is known as a
nonstandard or unintended model of \(S\). The branch
of mathematics called nonstandard analysis is based on nonstandard
models of mathematical statements about the real or complex number
systems; see
 Section 4
 below.
One also talks of model-theoretic semantics of natural
languages, which is a way of describing the meanings of
natural language sentences, not a way of giving them
meanings. The connection between this semantics and model theory is a
little indirect. It lies in Tarski’s truth definition of 1933.
See the entry on
 Tarski’s truth definitions
 for more details.
A sentence \(S\) divides all its possible interpretations into two
classes, those that are models of it and those that are not. In this
way it defines a class, namely the class of all its models, written
\(\Mod(S)\). To take a legal example, the sentence 
defines a class of structures which take the form of labelled
4-tuples, as for example (writing the label on the left): 
This is a typical model-theoretic definition, defining a class of
structures (in this case, the class known to the lawyers as
trusts). 
We can extend the idea of model-theoretic definition from a single
sentence \(S\) to a set \(T\) of sentences; \(\Mod(T)\) is the class
of all interpretations that are simultaneously models of all the
sentences in \(T\). When a set \(T\) of sentences is used to define a
class in this way, mathematicians say that \(T\) is a theory
or a set of axioms, and that \(T\) axiomatises the
class \(\Mod(T)\).
Take for example the following set of first-order sentences:
Here the labels are the addition symbol ‘+’, the minus
symbol ‘\(-\)’ and the constant symbol ‘0’. An
interpretation also needs to specify a domain for the quantifiers.
With one proviso, the models of this set of sentences are precisely
the structures that mathematicians know as abelian groups.
The proviso is that in an abelian group \(A\), the domain should
contain the interpretation of the symbol 0, and it should be closed
under the interpretations of the symbols + and \(-\). In mathematical
model theory one builds this condition (or the corresponding
conditions for other function and constant symbols) into the
definition of a structure. 
Each mathematical structure is tied to a particular first-order
language. A structure contains interpretations of certain predicate,
function and constant symbols; each predicate or function symbol has a
fixed arity. The collection \(K\) of these symbols is called the
signature of the structure. Symbols in the signature are
often called nonlogical constants, and an older name for them
is primitives. The first-order language of signature \(K\) is
the first-order language built up using the symbols in \(K\), together
with the equality sign =, to build up its atomic formulas. (See the
entry on
 classical logic.)
 If \(K\) is a signature, \(S\) is a sentence of the language of
signature \(K\) and \(A\) is a structure whose signature is \(K\),
then because the symbols match up, we know that \(A\) makes \(S\)
either true or false. So one defines the class of abelian groups to be
the class of all those structures of signature \(+\), \(-\), \(0\) which are
models of the sentences above. Apart from the fact that it uses a
formal first-order language, this is exactly the algebraists’
usual definition of the class of abelian groups; model theory
formalises a kind of definition that is extremely common in
mathematics.
Now the defining axioms for abelian groups have three kinds of symbol
(apart from punctuation). First there is the logical symbol = with a
fixed meaning. Second there are the nonlogical constants, which get
their interpretation by being applied to a particular structure; one
should group the quantifier symbols with them, because the structure
also determines the domain over which the quantifiers range. And third
there are the variables \(x, y\) etc. This three-level pattern of
symbols allows us to define classes in a second way. Instead of
looking for the interpretations of the nonlogical constants that will
make a sentence true, we fix the interpretations of the
nonlogical constants by choosing a particular structure \(A\), and we
look for assignments of elements of \(A\) to variables which will make
a given formula true in \(A\).
For example let \(\mathbb{Z}\) be the additive group of integers. Its
elements are the integers (positive, negative and 0), and the symbols
\(+\), \(-\), \(0\) have their usual meanings. Consider the formula
If we assign the number \(-3\) to \(v_1\) and the number \(-6\) to
\(v_2\), the formula works out as true in \(\mathbb{Z}\). We express
this by saying that the pair \((-3,-6)\) satisfies this
formula in \(\mathbf{Z}\). Likewise (15,30) and (0,0) satisfy
it, but \((2,-4)\) and (3,3) don’t. Thus the formula
defines a binary relation on the integers, namely the set of
pairs of integers that satisfy it. A relation defined in this way in a
structure \(A\) is called a first-order definable relation in
\(A\). A useful generalisation is to allow the defining formula to use
added names for some specific elements of \(A\); these elements are
called parameters and the relation is then definable with
parameters. 
This second type of definition, defining relations inside a structure
rather than classes of structure, also formalises a common
mathematical practice. But this time the practice belongs to geometry
rather than to algebra. You may recognise the relation in the field of
real numbers defined by the formula
It’s the circle of radius 1 around the origin in the real plane.
Algebraic geometry is full of definitions of this kind. 
During the 1940s it occurred to several people (chiefly Anatolii
Mal’tsev in Russia, Alfred Tarski in the USA and Abraham
Robinson in Britain) that the metatheorems of classical logic could be
used to prove mathematical theorems about classes defined in the two
ways we have just described. In 1950 both Robinson and Tarski were
invited to address the International Congress of Mathematicians at
Cambridge Mass. on this new discipline (which as yet had no name
– Tarski proposed the name ‘theory of models’ in
1954). The conclusion of Robinson’s address to that Congress is
worth quoting:
In fact Mal’tsev had already made quite deep applications of
model theory in group theory several years earlier, but under the
political conditions of the time his work in Russia was not yet known
in the West. By the end of the twentieth century, Robinson’s
hopes had been amply fulfilled; see the entry on
 first-order model theory.
There are at least two other kinds of definition in model theory
besides these two above. The third is known as interpretation
(a special case of the interpretations that we began with). Here we
start with a structure \(A\), and we build another structure \(B\)
whose signature need not be related to that of \(A\), by defining the
domain \(X\) of \(B\) and all the labelled relations and functions of
\(B\) to be the relations definable in \(A\) by certain formulas with
parameters. A further refinement is to find a definable equivalence
relation on \(X\) and take the domain of \(B\) to be not \(X\) itself
but the set of equivalence classes of this relation. The structure
\(B\) built in this way is said to be interpreted in the
structure \(A\).
A simple example, again from standard mathematics, is the
interpretation of the group \(\mathbb{Z}\) of integers in the
structure \(\mathbb{N}\) consisting of the natural numbers 0, 1, 2
etc. with labels for 0, 1 and +. To construct the domain of
\(\mathbb{Z}\) we first take the set \(X\) of all ordered pairs of
natural numbers (clearly a definable relation in \(\mathbb{N})\), and
on this set \(X\) we define the equivalence relation \(\sim\) by
(again definable). The domain of \(\mathbb{Z}\) consists of the
equivalence classes of this relation. We define addition on
\(\mathbb{Z}\) by 
The equivalence class of \((a,b)\) becomes the integer \(a - b\). 
When a structure \(B\) is interpreted in a structure \(A\), every
first-order statement about \(B\) can be translated back into a
first-order statement about \(A\), and in this way we can read off the
complete theory of \(B\) from that of \(A\). In fact if we carry out
this construction not just for a single structure \(A\) but for a
family of models of a theory \(T\), always using the same defining
formulas, then the resulting structures will all be models of a theory
\(T'\) that can be read off from \(T\) and the defining formulas. This
gives a precise sense to the statement that the theory \(T'\) is
interpreted in the theory \(T\). Philosophers of science have
sometimes experimented with this notion of interpretation as a way of
making precise what it means for one theory to be reducible to
another. But realistic examples of reductions between scientific
theories seem generally to be much subtler than this simple-minded
model-theoretic idea will allow. See the entry on
 intertheory relations in physics.
The fourth kind of definability is a pair of notions, implicit
definability and explicit definability of a particular relation in a
theory. See section 3.3 of the entry on
 first-order model theory.
Unfortunately there used to be a very confused theory about
model-theoretic axioms, that also went under the name of implicit
definition. By the end of the nineteenth century, mathematical
geometry had generally ceased to be a study of space, and it had
become the study of classes of structures which satisfy certain
‘geometric’ axioms. Geometric terms like
‘point’, ‘line’ and ‘between’
survived, but only as the primitive symbols in axioms; they no longer
had any meaning associated with them. So the old question, whether
Euclid’s parallel postulate (as a statement about space) was
deducible from Euclid’s other assumptions about space, was no
longer interesting to geometers. Instead, geometers showed that if one
wrote down an up-to-date version of Euclid’s other assumptions,
in the form of a theory \(T\), then it was possible to find models of
\(T\) which fail to satisfy the parallel postulate. (See the entry on
 geometry in the 19th century
 for the contributions of Lobachevski and Klein to this achievement.)
In 1899 David Hilbert published a book in which he constructed such
models, using exactly the method of interpretation that we have just
described.
Problems arose because of the way that Hilbert and others described
what they were doing. The history is complicated, but roughly the
following happened. Around the middle of the nineteenth century people
noticed, for example, that in an abelian group the minus function is
definable in terms of 0 and + (namely: \(-a\) is the element \(b\)
such that \(a + b = 0)\). Since this description of minus is in fact
one of the axioms defining abelian groups, we can say (using a term
taken from J. D. Gergonne, who should not be held responsible for the
later use made of it) that the axioms for abelian groups
implicitly define minus. In the jargon of the time, one said
not that the axioms define the function minus, but that they define
the concept minus. Now suppose we switch around and try to
define plus in terms of minus and 0. This way round it can’t be
done, since one can have two abelian groups with the same 0 and minus
but different plus functions. Rather than say this, the nineteenth
century mathematicians concluded that the axioms only partially define
plus in terms of minus and 0. Having swallowed that much, they went on
to say that the axioms together form an implicit definition of the
concepts plus, minus and 0 together, and that this implicit definition
is only partial but it says about these concepts precisely as much as
we need to know.
One wonders how it could happen that for fifty years nobody challenged
this nonsense. In fact some people did challenge it, notably the
geometer Moritz Pasch who in section 12 of his Vorlesungen
über Neuere Geometrie (1882) insisted that geometric axioms
tell us nothing whatever about the meanings of ‘point’,
‘line’ etc. Instead, he said, the axioms give us
relations between the concepts. If one thinks of a structure
as a kind of ordered \(n\)-tuple of sets etc., then a class
\(\Mod(T)\) becomes an \(n\)-ary relation, and Pasch’s account
agrees with ours. But he was unable to spell out the details, and
there is some evidence that his contemporaries (and some more recent
commentators) thought he was saying that the axioms may not determine
the meanings of ‘point’ and ‘line’, but they
do determine those of relational terms such as ‘between’
and ‘incident with’! Frege’s demolition of the
implicit definition doctrine was masterly, but it came too late to
save Hilbert from saying, at the beginning of his Grundlagen der
Geometrie, that his axioms give ‘the exact and
mathematically adequate description’ of the relations
‘lie’, ‘between’ and ‘congruent’.
Fortunately Hilbert’s mathematics speaks for itself, and one can
simply bypass these philosophical faux pas. The model-theoretic
account that we now take as a correct description of this line of work
seems to have surfaced first in the group around Giuseppe Peano in the
1890s, and it reached the English-speaking world through Bertrand
Russell’s Principles of Mathematics in 1903.
Suppose \(L\) is a language of signature \(K, T\) is a set of
sentences of \(L\) and \(\phi\) is a sentence of \(L\). Then the
relation 
expresses that every structure of signature \(K\) which is a model of
\(T\) is also a model of \(\phi\). This is known as the
model-theoretic consequence relation, and it is written for
short as 
The double use of \(\vDash\) is a misfortune. But in the particular
case where \(L\) is first-order, the completeness theorem (see the
entry on
 classical logic)
 tells us that ‘\(T \vDash \phi\)’ holds if and only if
there is a proof of \(\phi\) from \(T\), a relation commonly
written
Since \(\vDash\) and \(\vdash\) express exactly the same relation in
this case, model theorists often avoid the double use of \(\vDash\) by
using \(\vdash\) for model-theoretic consequence. But since what
follows is not confined to first-order languages, safety suggests we
stick with \(\vDash\) here.
Before the middle of the nineteenth century, textbooks of logic
commonly taught the student how to check the validity of an argument
(say in English) by showing that it has one of a number of standard
forms, or by paraphrasing it into such a form. The standard forms were
syntactic and/or semantic forms of argument in English. The process
was hazardous: semantic forms are almost by definition not visible on
the surface, and there is no purely syntactic form that guarantees
validity of an argument. For this reason most of the old textbooks had
a long section on ‘fallacies’ – ways in which an
invalid argument may seem to be valid.
In 1847 George Boole changed this arrangement. For example, to
validate the argument
Boole would interpret the symbols \(P, Q, R\) as names of classes:
Then he would point out that the original argument paraphrases into a
set-theoretic consequence: 
(This example is from Stanley Jevons, 1869. Boole’s own account
is idiosyncratic, but I believe Jevons’ example represents
Boole’s intentions accurately.) Today we would write \(\forall
x(Px \rightarrow Qx)\) rather than \(P \subseteq Q\), but this is
essentially the standard definition of \(P \subseteq Q\), so the
difference between us and Boole is slight. 
Insofar as they follow Boole, modern textbooks of logic establish that
English arguments are valid by reducing them to model-theoretic
consequences. Since the class of model-theoretic consequences, at
least in first-order logic, has none of the vaguenesses of the old
argument forms, textbooks of logic in this style have long since
ceased to have a chapter on fallacies.
But there is one warning that survives from the old textbooks: If you
formalise your argument in a way that is not a
model-theoretic consequence, it doesn’t mean the argument is
not valid. It may only mean that you failed to analyse the
concepts in the argument deeply enough before you formalised. The old
textbooks used to discuss this in a ragbag section called
‘topics’ (i.e. hints for finding arguments that you might
have missed). Here is an example from Peter of Spain’s 13th
century Summulae Logicales:
Hilbert and Ackermann, possibly the textbook that did most to
establish the modern style, discuss in their section III.3 a very
similar example: ‘If there is a son, then there is a
father’. They point out that any attempt to justify this by
using the symbolism 
is doomed to failure. “A proof of this statement is possible
only if we analyze conceptually the meanings of the two predicates
which occur”, as they go on to illustrate. And of course the
analysis finds precisely the relation that Peter of Spain referred to.
On the other hand if your English argument translates into an invalid
model-theoretic consequence, a counterexample to the consequence may
well give clues about how you can describe a situation that would make
the premises of your argument true and the conclusion false. But this
is not guaranteed.
One can raise a number of questions about whether the modern textbook
procedure does really capture a sensible notion of logical
consequence. For example in Boole’s case the set-theoretic
consequences that he relies on are all easily provable by formal
proofs in first-order logic, not even using any set-theoretic axioms;
and by the completeness theorem (see the entry on
 classical logic)
 the same is true for first-order logic. But for some other logics it
is certainly not true. For instance the model-theoretic consequence
relation for some logics of time presupposes some facts about the
physical structure of time. Also, as Boole himself pointed out, his
translation from an English argument to its set-theoretic form
requires us to believe that for every property used in the argument,
there is a corresponding class of all the things that have the
property. This comes dangerously close to Frege’s inconsistent
comprehension axiom!
In 1936 Alfred Tarski proposed a definition of logical consequence for
arguments in a fully interpreted formal language. His proposal was
that an argument is valid if and only if: under any allowed
reinterpretation of its nonlogical symbols, if the premises are true
then so is the conclusion. Tarski assumed that the class of allowed
reinterpretations could be read off from the semantics of the
language, as set out in his
 truth definition.
 He left it undetermined what symbols count as nonlogical; in fact he
hoped that this freedom would allow one to define different kinds of
necessity, perhaps separating ‘logical’ from
‘analytic’. One thing that makes Tarski’s proposal
difficult to evaluate is that he completely ignores the question we
discussed above, of analysing the concepts to reach all the logical
connections between them. The only plausible explanation I can see for
this lies in his parenthetical remark about
This suggests to me that he wants his primitive signs to be by
stipulation unanalysable. But then by stipulation it will be
purely accidental if his notion of logical consequence captures
everything one would normally count as a logical consequence. 
Historians note a resemblance between Tarski’s proposal and one
in section 147 of Bernard Bolzano’s Wissenschaftslehre
of 1837. Like Tarski, Bolzano defines the validity of a proposition in
terms of the truth of a family of related propositions. Unlike Tarski,
Bolzano makes his proposal for propositions in the vernacular, not for
sentences of a formal language with a precisely defined semantics.
On all of this section, see also the entry on
 logical consequence.
A sentence \(S\) defines its class \(\Mod(S)\) of models. Given two
languages \(L\) and \(L'\), we can compare them by asking whether
every class \(\Mod(S)\), with \(S\) a sentence of \(L\), is also a
class of the form \(\Mod(S')\) where \(S'\) is a sentence of \(L'\).
If the answer is Yes, we say that \(L\) is reducible to
\(L'\), or that \(L'\) is at least as expressive as \(L\).
For example if \(L\) is a first-order language with identity, whose
signature consists of 1-ary predicate symbols, and \(L'\) is the
language whose sentences consist of the four syllogistic forms (All
\(A\) are \(B\), Some \(A\) are \(B\), No \(A\) are \(B\), Some \(A\)
are not \(B)\) using the same predicate symbols, then \(L'\) is
reducible to \(L\), because the syllogistic forms are expressible in
first-order logic. (There are some quarrels about which is the right
way to express them; see the entry on the traditional
 square of opposition.)
 But the first-order language \(L\) is certainly not reducible to the
language \(L'\) of syllogisms, since in \(L\) we can write down a
sentence saying that exactly three elements satisfy \(Px\), and there
is no way of saying this using just the syllogistic forms. Or moving
the other way, if we form a third language \(L''\) by adding to \(L\)
the quantifier \(Qx\) with the meaning “There are uncountably
many elements \(x\) such that …”, then trivially \(L\) is
reducible to \(L''\), but the downward Loewenheim-Skolem theorem shows
at once that \(L''\) is not reducible to \(L\).
These notions are useful for analysing the strength of database query
languages. We can think of the possible states of a database as
structures, and a simple Yes/No query becomes a sentence that elicits
the answer Yes if the database is a model of it and No otherwise. If
one database query language is not reducible to another, then the
first can express some query that can’t be expressed in the
second.
So we need techniques for comparing the expressive strengths of
languages. One of the most powerful techniques available consists of
the back-and-forth games of Ehrenfeucht and Fraïssé
between the two players Spoiler and Duplicator; see the entry on
 logic and games
 for details. Imagine for example that we play the usual first-order
back-and-forth game \(G\) between two structures \(A\) and \(B\). The
theory of these games establishes that if some first-order sentence
\(\phi\) is true in exactly one of \(A\) and \(B\), then there is a
number \(n\), calculable from \(\phi\), with the property that Spoiler
has a strategy for \(G\) that will guarantee that he wins in at most
\(n\) steps. So conversely, to show that first-order logic can’t
distinguish between \(A\) and \(B\), it suffices to show that for
every finite \(n\), Duplicator has a strategy that will guarantee she
doesn’t lose \(G\) in the first \(n\) steps. If we succeed in
showing this, it follows that any language which does distinguish
between \(A\) and \(B\) is not reducible to the first-order language
of the structures \(A\) and \(B\).
These back-and-forth games are immensely flexible. For a start, they
make just as much sense on finite structures as they do on infinite;
many other techniques of classical model theory assume that the
structures are infinite. They can also be adapted smoothly to many
non-first-order languages.
In 1969 Per Lindström used back-and-forth games to give some
abstract characterisations of first-order logic in terms of its
expressive power. One of his theorems says that if \(L\) is a language
with a signature \(K, L\) is closed under all the first-order
syntactic operations, and \(L\) obeys the downward Loewenheim-Skolem
theorem for single sentences, and the compactness theorem, then \(L\)
is reducible to the first-order language of signature \(K\). These
theorems are very attractive; see Chapter XII of Ebbinghaus, Flum and
Thomas for a good account. But they have never quite lived up to their
promise. It has been hard to find any similar characterisations of
other logics. Even for first-order logic it is a little hard to see
exactly what the characterisations tell us. But very roughly speaking,
they tell us that first-order logic is the unique logic with two
properties: (1) we can use it to express arbitrarily complicated
things about finite patterns, and (2) it is hopeless for
discriminating between one infinite cardinal and another.
These two properties (1) and (2) are just the properties of
first-order logic that allowed Abraham Robinson to build his
nonstandard analysis. The background is that Leibniz, when he
invented differential and integral calculus, used infinitesimals, i.e.
numbers that are greater than 0 and smaller than all of 1/2, 1/3, 1/4
etc. Unfortunately there are no such real numbers. During the
nineteenth century all definitions and proofs in the Leibniz style
were rewritten to talk of limits instead of infinitesimals. Now let
\(\mathbb{R}\) be the structure consisting of the field of real
numbers together with any structural features we care to give names
to: certainly plus and times, maybe the ordering, the set of integers,
the functions sin and log, etc. Let \(L\) be the first-order language
whose signature is that of \(\mathbb{R}\). Because of the expressive
strength of \(L\), we can write down any number of theorems of
calculus as sentences of \(L\). Because of the expressive weakness of
\(L\), there is no way that we can express in \(L\) that
\(\mathbb{R}\) has no infinitesimals. In fact Robinson used the
compactness theorem to build a structure \(\mathbb{R}'\) that is a
model of exactly the same sentences of \(L\) as \(\mathbb{R}\), but
which has infinitesimals. As Robinson showed, we can copy
Leibniz’s arguments using the infinitesimals in \(\mathbb{R}'\),
and so prove that various theorems of calculus are true in
\(\mathbb{R}'\). But these theorems are expressible in \(L\), so they
must also be true in \(\mathbb{R}\).
Since arguments using infinitesimals are usually easier to visualise
than arguments using limits, nonstandard analysis is a helpful tool
for mathematical analysts. Jacques Fleuriot in his Ph.D. thesis (2001)
automated the proof theory of nonstandard analysis and used it to
mechanise some of the proofs in Newton’s Principia.
To model a phenomenon is to construct a formal theory that
describes and explains it. In a closely related sense, you
model a system or structure that you plan to build, by
writing a description of it. These are very different senses of
‘model’ from that in model theory: the ‘model’
of the phenomenon or the system is not a structure but a theory, often
in a formal language. The Universal Modeling Language, UML
for short, is a formal language designed for just this purpose.
It’s reported that the Australian Navy once hired a model
theorist for a job ‘modelling hydrodynamic phenomena’.
(Please don’t enlighten them!) 
A little history will show how the word ‘model’ came to
have these two different uses. In late Latin a ‘modellus’
was a measuring device, for example to measure water or milk. By the
vagaries of language, the word generated three different words in
English: mould, module, model. Often a device that measures out a
quantity of a substance also imposes a form on the substance. We see
this with a cheese mould, and also with the metal letters (called
‘moduli’ in the early 17th century) that carry ink to
paper in printing. So ‘model’ comes to mean an object in
hand that expresses the design of some other objects in the world: the
artist’s model carries the form that the artist depicts, and
Christopher Wren’s ‘module’ of St Paul’s
Cathedral serves to guide the builders.
Already by the late 17th century the word ‘model’ could
mean an object that shows the form, not of real-world objects, but of
mathematical constructs. Leibniz boasted that he didn’t need
models in order to do mathematics. Other mathematicians were happy to
use plaster or metal models of interesting surfaces. The models of
model theory first appeared as abstract versions of this kind of
model, with theories in place of the defining equation of a surface.
On the other hand one could stay with real-world objects but show
their form through a theory rather than a physical copy in hand;
‘modelling’ is building such a theory.
We have a confusing halfway situation when a scientist describes a
phenomenon in the world by an equation, for example a differential
equation with exponential functions as solutions. Is the model the
theory consisting of the equation, or are these exponential functions
themselves models of the phenomenon? Examples of this kind, where
theory and structures give essentially the same information, provide
some support for Patrick Suppes’ claim that “the meaning
of the concept of model is the same in mathematics and the empirical
sciences” (1969, 12). Several
philosophers of science have pursued the idea of using an informal
version of model-theoretic models for scientific modelling. Sometimes
the models are described as non-linguistic – this might be hard
to reconcile with our definition of models in section 1 above.
Cognitive science is one area where the difference between models and
modelling tends to become blurred. A central question of cognitive
science is how we represent facts or possibilities in our minds. If
one formalises these mental representations, they become something
like ‘models of phenomena’. But it is a serious hypothesis
that in fact our mental representations have a good deal in common
with simple set-theoretic structures, so that they are
‘models’ in the model-theoretic sense too. In 1983 two
influential works of cognitive science were published, both under the
title Mental Models. The first, edited by Dedre Gentner and
Albert Stevens, was about people’s
‘conceptualizations’ of the elementary facts of physics;
it belongs squarely in the world of ‘modelling of
phenomena’. The second, by Philip Johnson-Laird, is largely
about reasoning, and makes several appeals to ‘model-theoretic
semantics’ in our sense. Researchers in the Johnson-Laird
tradition tend to refer to their approach as ‘model
theory’, and to see it as allied in some sense to what we have
called model theory.
Pictures and diagrams seem at first to hover in the middle ground
between theories and models. In practice model theorists often draw
themselves pictures of structures, and use the pictures to think about
the structures. On the other hand pictures don’t generally carry
the labelling that is an essential feature of model-theoretic
structures. There is a fast growing body of work on reasoning with
diagrams, and the overwhelming tendency of this work is to see
pictures and diagrams as a form of language rather than as a form of
structure. For example Eric Hammer and Norman Danner (1996) describe a
‘model theory of Venn diagrams’; the Venn diagrams
themselves are the syntax, and the model theory is a set-theoretical
explanation of their meaning.  (A curious counterexample is the
horizontal line diagrams of the 12th century Baghdad Jewish scholar
Abū l-Barakāt they represent structures and not
propositions, and Abū l-Barakāt uses them to express
model-theoretic consequence in syllogisms.  Further details are in
Hodges 2018 on model-theoretic consequence.)
The model theorist Yuri Gurevich introduced abstract state
machines (ASMs) as a way of using model-theoretic ideas for
specification in computer science. According to the Abstract State
Machine website (see Other Internet Resources below),
The book of Börger and Stärk cited below is an authoritative
account of ASMs and their uses. 
Today you can make your name and fortune by finding a good
representation system. There is no reason to expect that every such
system will fit neatly into the syntax/semantics framework of model
theory, but it will be surprising if model-theoretic ideas don’t
continue to make a major contribution in this area.
