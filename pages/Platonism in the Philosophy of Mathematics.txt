Mathematical platonism can be defined as the conjunction of the
following three theses:
Existence.
  There are mathematical objects.
Abstractness.
   Mathematical objects are abstract.
Independence.
   Mathematical objects are independent
    of intelligent agents and their language, thought, and practices.
Some representative definitions of ‘mathematical
platonism’ are listed in the supplement
Some Definitions of Platonism
and document that the above definition is fairly standard.
Platonism in general (as opposed to platonism about mathematics
specifically) is any view that arises from the above three claims by
replacing the adjective ‘mathematical’ by any other
adjective.
The first two claims are tolerably clear for present purposes.
Existence can be formalized as
‘∃xMx’, where
‘Mx’ abbreviates the predicate ‘x
is a mathematical object’ which is true of all and only the
objects studied by pure mathematics, such as numbers, sets, and
functions. Abstractness says that every mathematical object is
abstract, where an object is said to be abstract just in case it is
non-spatiotemporal and (therefore) causally inefficacious. (For further
discussion, see the entry on
 abstract objects.)
Independence is less clear than the other two claims. What does it
mean to ascribe this sort of independence to an object? The most
obvious gloss is probably the counterfactual conditional that, had
there not been any intelligent agents, or had their language, thought,
or practices been different, there would still have been mathematical
objects. However, it is doubtful that this gloss will do all the work that
Independence is supposed to do (see Section
 4.1). For now, Independence will
be left somewhat schematic.
Platonism must be distinguished from the view of the historical
Plato. Few parties to the contemporary debate about platonism make
strong exegetical claims about Plato’s view, much less defend it.
Although the view which we are calling ‘platonism’ is
inspired by Plato’s famous theory of abstract and eternal Forms (see
the entry on
 Plato’s metaphysics and epistemology),
 platonism is now defined and debated
independently of its original historical inspiration.
Not only is the platonism under discussion not Plato’s, platonism as
characterized above is a purely metaphysical view: it should be
distinguished from other views that have substantive epistemological
content. Many older characterizations of platonism add strong
epistemological claims to the effect that we have some immediate grasp
of, or insight into, the realm of abstract objects. (See e.g., Rees
1967.) But it is useful (and nowadays fairly standard) to reserve the
term ‘platonism’ for the purely metaphysical view described
above. Many philosophers who defend platonism in this purely
metaphysical sense would reject the additional epistemological claims.
Examples include Quine and other philosophers attracted to the
so-called indispensability argument, which seeks to give a
broadly empirical defense of mathematical platonism. (See the entry
 on
 indispensability arguments in the philosophy of mathematics.)
Finally, the above definition of ‘mathematical
platonism’ excludes the claim that all truths of pure mathematics
are necessary, although this claim has traditionally been made by most
platonists. Again, this exclusion is justified by the fact that some
philosophers who are generally regarded as platonists (for instance,
Quine and some adherents of the aforementioned indispensability
argument) reject this additional modal claim .
Mathematical platonism has considerable philosophical significance.
If the view is true, it will put great pressure on the physicalist idea
that reality is exhausted by the physical. For platonism entails that
reality extends far beyond the physical world and includes objects
which aren’t part of the causal and spatiotemporal order studied by the
physical
 sciences.[1]
Mathematical platonism, if true, will also
put great pressure on many naturalistic theories of knowledge. For
there is little doubt that we possess mathematical knowledge.
The truth of mathematical platonism would therefore establish that we have knowledge
of abstract (and thus causally inefficacious) objects. This would be an
important discovery, which many naturalistic theories of knowledge
would struggle to  accommodate.
Although these philosophical consequences are not unique to
mathematical platonism, this particular form of platonism is
unusually well suited to support such consequences. For mathematics is
a remarkably successful discipline, both in its own right and as a tool
for other
 sciences.[2]
 Few contemporary analytic philosophers are
willing to contradict any of the core claims of a discipline whose
scientific credentials are as strong as those of mathematics (Lewis
1991, pp. 57–9). So if philosophical analysis revealed
mathematics to have some strange and surprising consequences, it would
be unattractive simply to reject
 mathematics.[3]
 A form of platonism based
on a discipline whose scientific credentials are less impressive than
those of mathematics would not be in this fortunate situation. For
instance, when theology turns out to have some strange and surprising
philosophical consequences, many philosophers do not hesitate to
reject the relevant parts of theology.
Let object realism be the view that there exist abstract
mathematical objects. Object realism is thus just the conjunction
of Existence and
Abstractness.[4] 
Object realism stands opposed
to nominalism, which in contemporary philosophy is typically
defined as the view that there are no abstract objects. (In more
traditional philosophical usage the word ‘nominalism’
refers instead to the view that there are no universals. See Burgess
& Rosen 1997, pp. 13–25 and the entry
on abstract objects.)
Because object realism leaves out Independence, this view is
logically weaker than mathematical platonism. The philosophical
consequences of object realism are thus not as strong as those of
platonism. Many physicalists would accept non-physical objects
provided that these are dependent on or reducible to physical
objects. They may for instance accept objects such as corporations,
laws, and poems, provided that these are suitably dependent or
reducible to physical objects. Moreover, there appears to be no
mystery about epistemic access to non-physical objects that we have
somehow made or ‘constituted’. If corporations, laws, and
poems are made or ‘constituted’ by us, presumably we gain
knowledge of them in the process of making or
‘constituting’ them.
Some views in the philosophy of mathematics are object realist
without being platonist. One example are traditional intuitionist
views, which affirm the existence of mathematical objects but maintain
that these objects depend on or are constituted by mathematicians and
their
 activities.[5]
 Some further examples of views that are
object realist without being platonist will be discussed in Section
 4.
Truth-value realism is the view that every well-formed
mathematical statement has a unique and objective truth-value that is
independent of whether it can be known by us and whether it follows
logically from our current mathematical theories. The view also holds
that most mathematical statements that are deemed to be true are in
fact true.  So truth-value realism is clearly a
metaphysical view. But unlike platonism it is not an
ontological view. For although truth-value realism claims
that mathematical statements have unique and objective truth-values,
it is not committed to the distinctively platonist idea that these
truth-values are to be explained in terms of an ontology of
mathematical objects.
Mathematical platonism clearly motivates truth-value realism by
providing an account of how mathematical statements get their
truth-values. But the former view does not entail the latter unless
further premises are added. For even if there are mathematical
objects, referential and quantificational indeterminacy may deprive
mathematical statements of a unique and objective
truth-value. Conversely, truth-value realism does not by itself
entail Existence and thus implies neither object realism nor
platonism. For there are various accounts of how mathematical
statements can come to possess unique and objective truth-values which
do not posit a realm of mathematical
objects.[6]
In fact, many nominalists endorse truth-value realism, at least
about more basic branches of mathematics, such as arithmetic.
Nominalists of this type are committed to the slightly odd-sounding
view that, although the ordinary mathematical statement
(1) There are primes numbers between 10 and 20.
is true, there are in fact no mathematical objects and thus in
particular no numbers. But there is no contradiction here. We must
distinguish between the language LM in which mathematicians
make their claims and the language LP in which nominalists
and other philosophers make theirs. The statement (1) is made in
LM. But the nominalist’s assertion that (1) is
true but that there are no abstract objects is made
in LP. The nominalist’s assertion is thus
perfectly coherent provided that (1) is translated non-homophonically
from LM into LP.  And indeed,
when the nominalist claims that the truth-values of sentences
of LM are fixed in a way which doesn’t appeal to
mathematical objects, it is precisely this sort of non-homophonic
translation she has in mind. The view mentioned in the previous note
provides an example.
This shows that for the claim Existence to have its intended
effect, it must be expressed in the language LP
used by us philosophers. If the claim was expressed in the
language LM used by mathematicians, then
nominalists could accept the claim while still denying that there are
mathematical objects, contrary to the purpose of the claim.
A small but important tradition of philosophers urge that the debate
about platonism should be replaced by, or at least transformed into, a
debate about truth-value realism. One reason offered in support of this view is
that the former debate is hopelessly unclear, while the latter is more
tractable (Dummett 1978a, pp. 228–232 and Dummett 1991b, pp.
10–15). Another reason offered is that the debate about
truth-value realism is of greater importance to both philosophy and
mathematics than the one about
 platonism.[7]
Working realism is the methodological view that mathematics
should be practiced as if platonism was true (Bernays 1935,
Shapiro 1997, pp. 21–27 and 38–44). This requires some
explanation. In debates about the foundations of mathematics platonism
has often been used to defend certain mathematical methods, such as the
following:
According to working realism, these and other classical methods are
acceptable and available in all mathematical reasoning. But working
realism does not take a stand on whether these methods require any
philosophical defense, and if so, whether this defense must be based on
platonism. In short, where platonism is an explicitly philosophical
view, working realism is first and foremost a view within mathematics
itself about the correct methodology of this discipline. Platonism and
working realism are therefore distinct views.
However, there may of course be logical relations between the two
views. Given the origin of working realism, it is not surprising that
the view receives strong support from mathematical platonism. Assume
that mathematical platonism is true. Then clearly the language of
mathematics ought to be as described in (i). Secondly, provided it is
legitimate to reason classically about any independently existing part
of reality, (ii) would also follow. Thirdly, since platonism ensures
that mathematics is discovered rather than invented, there would be no
need for mathematicians to restrict themselves to constructive methods
and axioms, which establishes (iii). Fourth, there is a powerful and
influential argument due to Gödel (1944) that impredicative
definitions are legitimate whenever the objects being defined exist
independently of our definitions. (For instance, ‘the tallest
boy in the class’ appears unproblematic despite being
impredicative.)  If this is correct, then (iv) would follow. Finally,
if mathematics is about some independently existing reality, then
every mathematical problem has a unique and determinate answer, which
provides at least some motivation for Hilbertian optimism. (See,
however, the discussion of plenitudinous platonism in Section
 4.2.)
The truth of mathematical platonism would therefore have important
consequences within mathematics itself. It would justify the classical
methods associated with working realism and encourage the search for
new axioms to settle questions (such as the Continuum Hypothesis) which
are left open by our current mathematical theories.
However, working realism does not in any obvious way imply
platonism. Although working realism says that we are justified in
using the platonistic language of contemporary mathematics, this falls
short of platonism in at least two ways. As the above discussion of
truth-value realism showed, the platonistic language of mathematics
can be analysed in such a way as to avoid reference to and
quantification over mathematical objects. Moreover, even if a
face-value analysis of the language of mathematics could be justified,
this would support object realism but not platonism. An
additional argument would be needed for the third component of
platonism, namely, Independence. The prospects for such an
argument are discussed in Section
 4.1.
We now describe a template of an argument for the existence of
mathematical objects. Since the first philosopher who developed an
argument of this general form was Frege, it will be referred to as
the Fregean argument. But the template is general and
abstracts away from most specific aspects of Frege’s own defense of the
existence of mathematical objects, such as his view that arithmetic is
reducible to logic. Fregean logicism is just one way in which this
template can be developed; some other ways will be mentioned below.
The Fregean argument is based on two premises, the first of which
concerns the semantics of the language of mathematics:
Classical Semantics.
  The singular terms of the
language of mathematics purport to refer to mathematical objects, and
its first-order quantifiers purport to range over such objects.
The word ‘purport’ needs to be explained. When a
sentence S purports to refer or quantify in a certain way,
this means that for S to be true, S must succeed in
referring or quantifying in this way.
The second premise does not require much explanation:
Truth.
 Most sentences accepted as mathematical
theorems are true (regardless of their syntactic and semantic
structure).
 
Consider sentences which are accepted as mathematical theorems and
which contain one or more mathematical singular terms. By Truth, most
of these sentences are
 true.[9]
 Let S be one such sentence. By Classical Semantics, the truth
of S requires that its singular terms succeed in referring to
mathematical objects. Hence there must be mathematical objects, as
asserted by
 Existence.[10]
Classical Semantics claims that the language of mathematics
functions semantically much like language in general functions (or at
least has traditionally been assumed to function): the semantic
functions of singular terms and quantifiers are to refer
to objects and to range over objects, respectively. This is a broadly empirical claim
about the workings of a semi-formal language used by the community of
professional mathematicians. (In the widely adopted terminology of
Burgess & Rosen 1997, pp. 6–7, Classical Semantics is a
hermeneutic claim; that is, it is a descriptive claim about
how a certain language is actually used, not a normative claim about
how this language ought to be used.) Note also that Classical Semantics
is compatible with most traditional views on semantics; in particular,
it is compatible with all the standard views on the meanings of
sentences, namely that they are truth-values, propositions, or sets of
possible worlds.
Classical Semantics enjoys strong prima facie plausibility.
For the language of mathematics strongly appears to have the same
semantic structure as ordinary non-mathematical language. As Burgess
(1999) observes, the following two sentences appear to have the same
simple semantic structure of a predicate being ascribed to a subject
(p. 288):
(4) Evelyn is prim.
(5) Eleven is prime.
This appearance is also borne out by the standard semantic analyses
proposed by linguists and semanticists.
Classical Semantics has nevertheless been challenged, for
instance by nominalists such as Hellman (1989) and by Hofweber
(2005 and 2016). (See also Moltmann (2013) for some challenges concerned with
arithmetical vocabulary in natural language.) This is not the place
for an extended discussion of such challenges. Let me just note that a
lot of work is needed to substantiate this sort of challenge. The
challenger will have to argue that the apparent semantic similarities
between mathematical and non-mathematical language are deceptive. And
these arguments will have to be of the sort that linguists and
semanticists—with no vested interest in the philosophy of
mathematics—could come to recognize as
significant.[11]
Truth can be defended in a variety of different ways. Common to all
defenses is that they first identify some standard by which the
truth-values of mathematical statements can be assessed and then argue
that mathematical theorems meet this standard.
One option is to appeal to a standard that is more fundamental than
that of mathematics itself. Logicism provides an example. Frege and
other logicists first claim that any theorem of pure logic is true.
Then they attempt to show that the theorems of certain branches of
mathematics can be proved from pure logic and definitions alone.
Another option is to appeal to the standards of empirical science.
The Quine-Putnam indispensability argument provides an example. First
it is argued that any indispensable part of empirical science is
likely to be true and therefore something we are justified in
believing. Then it is argued that large amounts of mathematics are
indispensable to empirical science. If both claims are correct, it
follows that Truth is likely to be true and that belief
in Truth therefore is justified. (See the entry on
 indispensability arguments in the philosophy of mathematics.)
A third option is to appeal to the standards of mathematics itself.
Why should one have to appeal to non-mathematical standards, such as
those of logic or empirical science, in order to defend the truth of
mathematical theorems? When we defend the truth of the claims of logic
and physics, we do not need to appeal to standards outside of
respectively logic and physics. Rather we assume that logic and physics
provide their own sui generis standards of justification. Why
should mathematics be any different? This third strategy has received a
lot of attention in recent years, often under the heading of
‘naturalism’ or ‘mathematical naturalism’. (See
Burgess & Rosen 1997, Maddy 1997, and, for critical discussion,
see the entry on
 naturalism in the philosophy of mathematics.)
Here is an example of how a naturalistic strategy can be developed.
Call the attitude that mathematicians take to the theorems of
mathematics ‘acceptance’. Then the following claims seem
plausible:
(6) Mathematicians are justified in accepting the theorems
of mathematics.
(7) Accepting a mathematical statement S involves
taking S to be true.
(8) When a mathematician accepts a mathematical statement
S, the content of this attitude is in general the literal
meaning of S.
From these three claims it follows that mathematical experts are
justified in taking the theorems of mathematics to be literal truths.
By extension the rest of us too are justified in believing Truth. Note
that the experts with whom (6) is concerned need not themselves believe
(7) and (8), let alone be justified in any such belief. What matters is
that the three claims are true. The task of establishing the truth of
(7) and (8) may fall to linguists, psychologists, sociologists, or
philosophers, but certainly not to mathematicians themselves.
Versions of the Fregean argument are sometimes stated in terms of
the notion of ontological commitment. Assume we operate with the
standard Quinean criterion of ontological commitment:
Quine’s Criterion.
 A first-order sentence (or
collection of such sentences) is ontologically committed to such
objects as must be assumed to be in the range of the variables for the
sentence (or collection of sentences) to be true.
Then it follows from Classical Semantics that many sentences of
mathematics are ontologically committed to mathematical objects. To see
this, consider a typical mathematical theorem S, which
involves some normal extensional occurrence of either singular terms or
first-order quantifiers. By Classical Semantics, these expressions
purport to refer to or range over mathematical objects. For S
to be true, these expressions must succeed in doing what they purport
to do. Consequently, for S to be true, there must be
mathematical objects in the range of the variables. By Quine’s
Criterion this means that S is ontologically committed to
mathematical objects.
Quine and many others take Quine’s Criterion to be little more than
a definition of the term ‘ontological commitment’ (Quine
1969 and Burgess 2004). But the criterion has nevertheless been
challenged. Some philosophers deny that singular terms and first-order
quantifiers automatically give rise to ontological commitments. Perhaps
what is “required of the world” for the sentence to be true
involves the existence of some but not all of the objects in the range
of the quantifiers (Rayo 2008). Or perhaps we should sever the link
between the first-order existential quantifier and the notion of
ontological commitment (Azzouni 2004, Hofweber 2000 and 2016).
One response to these challenges is to observe that the Fregean
argument was developed above without any use of the term
‘ontological commitment’. Any challenge to the definition
of ‘ontological commitment’ provided by Quine’s
Criterion therefore appears irrelevant to the version of the
Fregean argument developed above. However, this response is unlikely
to satisfy the challengers, who will respond that the conclusion of
the argument developed above is too weak to have its intended
effect. Recall that the conclusion, Existence, is formalized in
our philosophical meta-language LP as
‘∃xMx’. So this formalization will
fail to have its intended effect unless this meta-language sentence is
of the sort that incurs ontological commitment. But that is precisely
what the challengers dispute. This controversy cannot be pursued
further here. For now, we simply observe that the challengers need to provide an
account of why their non-standard notion of ontological commitment is
better and theoretically more interesting than the standard Quinean
notion.
Suppose we accept Existence, perhaps based on the Fregean
argument. As we have seen, this is not yet to accept mathematical
platonism, which is the result of adding to
Existence the two further claims Abstractness and
Independence. Are these two further claims defensible?
By the standards of philosophy, Abstractness has remained
relatively uncontroversial. Among the few philosophers to have
challenged it are Maddy (1990) (concerning impure sets) and Bigelow
(1988) (concerning sets and various kinds of numbers). This relative
lack of controversy means that few explicit defenses
of Abstractness have been developed.  But it is not hard to see
how such a defense might go. Here is one idea. It is a
plausible prima facie constraint on any philosophical
interpretation of mathematical practice that it should avoid ascribing
to mathematics any features which would render actual mathematical
practice misguided or inadequate. This constraint makes it hard to
deny that the objects of pure mathematics are abstract. For if these
objects had spatiotemporal locations, then actual mathematical
practice would be misguided and inadequate, since pure mathematicians
ought then to take an interest in the locations of their objects, just
as zoologists take an interest in the locations of animals. The fact
that pure mathematicians take no interest in this question suggests
that their objects are abstract.
Independence says that mathematical objects, if there are any,
are independent of intelligent agents and their language, thought, and
practices. We will discuss what this thesis might amount to, and how it might be defended, in Section
 4. 

3. Objections to Mathematical Platonism


A variety of objections to mathematical platonism have been
developed. Here are the most important ones.
3.1 Epistemological access


The most influential objection is probably the one inspired by
Benacerraf (1973). What follows is an improved version of Benacerraf’s
objection due to Field
 (1989).[12]
 This version relies on the following three premises.


Premise 1.
Mathematicians are reliable, in the sense that for almost every
mathematical sentence S, if mathematicians accept S,
then S is true.


Premise 2.
For belief in mathematics to be justified, it must at least in
principle be possible to explain the reliability described in Premise
1.


Premise 3.
If mathematical platonism is true, then this reliability cannot be
explained even in principle.




If these three premises are correct, it will follow that
mathematical platonism undercuts our justification for believing in
mathematics.


But are the premises correct? The first two premises are relatively
uncontroversial. Most platonists are already committed to Premise 1.
And Premise 2 seems fairly secure. If the reliability of some belief
formation procedure could not even in principle be explained, then the
procedure would seem to work purely by chance, thus undercutting any
justification we have for the beliefs produced in this way.


Premise 3 is far more controversial. Field defends this premise by
observing that “the truth-values of our mathematical assertions
depend on facts involving platonic entities that reside in a realm
outside of space-time” (Field 1989, p. 68) and thus are causally
isolated from us even in principle. However, this defense assumes that
any adequate explanation of the reliability in question must involve
some causal correlation. This has been challenged by a variety of
philosophers who have proposed more minimal explanations of the
reliability claim. (See Burgess & Rosen 1997, pp. 41–49 and
Lewis 1991, pp. 111–112; cf. also Clarke-Doane 2016. See Linnebo
2006 for a 
critique.)[13]
3.2 A metaphysical objection


Another famous article by Benacerraf develops a metaphysical objection
to mathematical platonism (Benacerraf 1965, cf. also Kitcher
1978). Although Benacerraf focuses on arithmetic, the objection
naturally generalizes to most pure mathematical objects.


Benacerraf opens by defending what is now known as a structuralist
view of the natural numbers, according to which the natural numbers
have no properties other than those they have in virtue of being
positions in an ω-sequence. For instance, there is nothing more
to being the number 3 than having certain intrastructurally defined
relational properties, such as succeeding 2, being half of 6, and being
prime. No matter how hard we study arithmetic and set theory, we will
never know whether 3 is identical with the fourth von Neumann ordinal,
or with the corresponding Zermelo ordinal, or perhaps, as Frege
suggested, with the class of all three-membered classes (in some system
that allows such classes to exist).


Benacerraf now draws the following conclusion:
Therefore, numbers are not objects at all, because in
giving the properties …of numbers you merely characterize an
abstract structure—and the distinction lies in the fact that the
“elements” of the structure have no properties other than
those relating them to other “elements” of the same
structure. (Benacerraf 1965, p. 291)


In other words, Benacerraf claims that there can be no objects which
have nothing but structural properties. All objects must have some
non-structural properties as well. (See Benacerraf 1996 for some
later reflections on this argument.)


Both of the steps of Benacerraf’s argument are
controversial. The first step—that natural numbers have only
structural properties—has recently been defended by a variety of
mathematical structuralists (Parsons 1990, Resnik 1997, and Shapiro
1997). But this step is denied by logicists and neo-logicists, who
claim that the natural numbers are intrinsically tied to the
cardinalities of the collections that they number. And the second
step—that there can be no objects with only structural
properties—is explicitly rejected by all of the structuralists
who defend the first step. (For some voices sympathetic to the second
step, see Hellman 2001 and MacBride 2005. See also Linnebo 2008 for
discussion.)
3.3 Other metaphysical objections


In addition to Benacerraf’s, a variety of metaphysical objections to
mathematical platonism have been developed. One of the more famous
examples is an argument of Nelson Goodman’s against set
theory. Goodman (1956) defends the Principle of Nominalism,
which states that whenever two entities have the same basic
constituents, they are identical. This principle can be regarded as a
strengthening of the familiar set theoretic axiom of
extensionality. The axiom of extensionality states that if two
sets x and y have the same elements—that is,
if ∀u(u ∈ x ↔ u
∈ y)—then they are identical. The Principle of
Nominalism is obtained by replacing the membership relation with its
transitive
 closure.[14]
 The principle thus states that if x and y are borne
∈* by the same individuals—that is,
if ∀u(u ∈* x ↔ u ∈*
y)—then x and y are identical. By
endorsing this principle, Goodman disallows the formation of sets and
classes, allowing only the formation of mereological sums and the
application to the standard mereological operations (as described by
his “calculus of individuals”).


However, Goodman’s defense of the Principle of Nominalism is now
widely held to be unconvincing, as witnessed by the widespread
acceptance by philosophers and mathematicians of set theory as a
legitimate and valuable branch of mathematics.
4. Between object realism and mathematical platonism


Object realism says there exist abstract mathematical objects,
whereas platonism adds Independence, which says that mathematical
objects are independent of intelligent agents and their language,
thought, and practices. This final section
surveys some lightweight forms of object realism that stop short of full-fledged platonism.
4.1 How To Understand Independence


A natural gloss on Independence is the counterfactual
conditional that, had there not been any intelligent agents, or had
their language, thought, or practices been suitably different, there
would still have been mathematical objects.



This counterfactual independence (as we may call it) is accepted by
most analytic philosophers. To see why, consider the role that
mathematics plays in our reasoning. We often reason about scenarios
that aren’t actual. Were we to build a bridge across this canyon, say,
how strong would it have to be to withstand the powerful gusts of
wind? Sadly, the previous bridge collapsed. Would it have done so had
the steel girders been twice as thick? This form of reasoning about
counterfactual scenarios is indispensable both to our everyday
deliberations and to science. The permissibility of such reasoning has
an important consequence. Since the truths of pure mathematics can
freely be appealed to throughout our counterfactual reasoning, it
follows that these truths are counterfactually independent of us
humans, and all other intelligent life for that matter. That is, had
been there been no intelligent life, these truths would still have
remained the same. 


Pure mathematics is in this respect very different from ordinary
empirical truths. Had intelligent life never existed, this article
would not have been written. More interestingly, pure mathematics also
contrasts with various social conventions and constructions, with
which it is sometimes compared (Cole 2009, Feferman 2009, Hersh
1997). Had intelligent life never existed, there would have been no
laws, contracts, or marriages—yet the mathematical truths would
have remained the same. 


Thus, if Independence is understood merely as counterfactual
independence, then anyone who accepts object realism should also
accept platonism. 


It is doubtful that this understanding of Independence is
sufficient, however. For Independence is meant to substantiate
an analogy between mathematical objects and ordinary physical
objects. Just as electrons and planets exist independently of us, so
do numbers and sets. And just as statements about electrons and
planets are made true or false by the objects with which they are
concerned and these objects’ perfectly objective properties, so are
statements about numbers and sets. In short, mathematical objects are
just as “real” as ordinary physical objects (if not even more so, as
Plato thought). 


Let us now consider some views that reject this stronger understanding
of Independence in terms of the mentioned analogy. These views
are thus lightweight forms of object realism, which stop short of
full-blown platonism. 
4.2 Plenitudious platonism


One lightweight form of object realism is the “full-blooded
platonism” of Balaguer 1998. This view is characterized by
a plenitude principle to the effect that any mathematical
objects that could exist actually do exist. For instance, since the
Continuum Hypothesis is independent of the standard axiomatization of
set theory, there is a universe of sets in which the hypothesis is
true and another in which it is false. And neither universe is
metaphysically privileged. By contrast, traditional platonism asserts
that there is a unique universe of sets in which the Continuum
Hypothesis is either determinately true or determinately
false.[15]


One alleged benefit of this plenitudinous view is in the
epistemology of mathematics. If every consistent mathematical theory is
true of some universe of mathematical objects, then mathematical
knowledge will, in some sense, be easy to obtain: provided that our
mathematical theories are consistent, they are guaranteed to be true of
some universe of mathematical objects.


However, “full-blooded platonism” has received much
criticism. Colyvan and Zalta 1999 criticize it for undermining the
possibility of reference to mathematical objects, and Restall 2003,
for lacking a precise and coherent formulation of the plenitude
principle on which the view is based. Martin (2001) proposes that
different universes of sets be amalgamated to yield a single maximal
universe, which will be privileged by fitting our conception of set
better than any other universe of sets.


A different version of plenitudinous platonism is developed in Linsky
& Zalta 1995 and a series of further articles. (See, for instance,
Linsky & Zalta 2006 and other articles cited therein.)
Traditional platonism goes wrong by “conceiv[ing] of abstract
objects on the model of physical objects” (Linsky & Zalta
1995, p. 533), including in particular the idea that such objects are
“sparse” rather than plenitudinous. Linsky & Zalta
develop an alternative approach on the basis of the second author’s
“object theory”. The main feature of object theory is a
very general comprehension principle which asserts the existence of a
plenitude of abstract objects: for any collection of properties, there
is an abstract object which “encodes” precisely these
properties. In object theory, moreover, two abstract objects are
identical just in case they encode precisely the same properties.
Object theory’s comprehension principle and identity criterion are
said to “provide the link between our cognitive faculty of
understanding and abstract objects” (ibid.,
p. 547). (See Ebert & Rossberg 2007 for critical discussion.)
4.3 Lightweight semantic values


Assume that object realism is true. For convenience, assume also
Classical Semantics. These assumptions ensure that the singular
terms and quantifiers of mathematical language refer to and range over
abstract objects. Given these assumptions, should one also be a
mathematical platonist? In other words, do the objects that mathematical
sentences refer to and quantify over satisfy Independence or
some similar condition?


It will be useful to restate our assumptions in more neutral terms.
We can do this by invoking the notion of a semantic value,
which plays an important role in semantics and the philosophy of
language. In these fields it is widely assumed that each expression
makes some definite contribution to the truth-value of sentences in
which the expression occurs. This contribution is known as the
semantic value of the expression. It is widely assumed that
(at least in extensional contexts) the semantic value of a singular
term is just its referent.


Our assumptions can now be stated neutrally as the claim that
mathematical singular terms have abstract semantic values and that its
quantifiers range over the kinds of item that serve as semantic values.
Let’s focus on the claim about singular terms. What is the
philosophical significance of this claim? In particular, does it
support some version of Independence? The answer will depend on what is
required for a mathematical singular term to have a semantic value.


Some philosophers argue that not very much is required (Frege 1953,
Dummett 1981, Dummett 1991a, Wright 1983, Hale & Wright 2000, Rayo
2013, and Linnebo 2012 and 2018). It suffices for the term t
to make some definite contribution to the truth-values of sentences in
which it occurs. The whole purpose of the notion of a semantic value
was to represent such contributions. It therefore suffices for a
singular term to possess a semantic value that it makes some such
suitable contribution.


This may even open the way for a form of non-eliminative reductionism
about mathematical objects (Dummett 1991a, Linnebo 2018). Although it
is perfectly true that the mathematical singular term t has
an abstract object as its semantic value, this truth may obtain in
virtue of more basic facts which do not mention or involve the
relevant abstract object. Compare for instance the relation of
ownership that obtains between a person and her bank account.
Although it is perfectly true that the person owns the bank account,
this truth may obtain in virtue of more basic sociological or
psychological facts which do not mention or involve the bank
account.


If some lightweight account of semantic values is defensible, we can
accept the assumptions of object realism and Classical Semantics
without committing ourselves to any traditional or robust form of
platonism.
4.4 Two further lightweight forms of object realism

 
We conclude by describing two further examples of lightweight forms of
object realism that reject the platonistic analogy between
mathematical objects and ordinary physical objects.


First, perhaps mathematical objects exist only in a potential manner,
which contrasts with the actual mode of existence of ordinary physical
objects. This idea is at the heart of the ancient notion of potential
infinity (Lear 1980, Linnebo & Shapiro 2017). According to
Aristotle, the natural numbers are potentially infinite in the
sense that, however large a number we have produced (by instantiating
it in the physical world), it is possible to produce an even larger
number. But Aristotle denies that the natural numbers
are actually infinite: this would require the physical world to
be infinite, which he argues is impossible. 


Following Cantor, most mathematicians and philosophers now defend the
actual infinity of the natural numbers. This is made possible in part
by denying the Aristotelian requirement that every number needs to be
instantiated in the physical world. When this is denied, the actual
infinity of the natural numbers no longer entails the actual infinity
of the physical world. 


However, a form of potentialism about the hierarchy of sets continues
to enjoy considerable support, especially in connection with the
iterative conception of sets (Parsons 1977, Jané 2010, Linnebo 2013,
Studd 2013). No matter how many sets have been formed, it is possible
to form even more. If true, this would mean that sets have a potential
form of existence which distinguishes them sharply from ordinary
physical objects. 


Second, perhaps mathematical objects are ontologically dependent or
derivative in a way that distinguishes them from independently
existing physical objects (Rosen 2011, Donaldson 2017). For example,
on the Aristotelian view just mentioned, a natural number depends for
its existence on some instantiation or other in the physical
world. There are other versions of the view as well. For example, Kit
Fine (1995) and others argue that a set is ontologically dependent on
its elements. (This view is also closely related to the set-theoretic
potentialism mentioned above.) 
A variety of objections to mathematical platonism have been
developed. Here are the most important ones.
The most influential objection is probably the one inspired by
Benacerraf (1973). What follows is an improved version of Benacerraf’s
objection due to Field
 (1989).[12]
 This version relies on the following three premises.
If these three premises are correct, it will follow that
mathematical platonism undercuts our justification for believing in
mathematics.
But are the premises correct? The first two premises are relatively
uncontroversial. Most platonists are already committed to Premise 1.
And Premise 2 seems fairly secure. If the reliability of some belief
formation procedure could not even in principle be explained, then the
procedure would seem to work purely by chance, thus undercutting any
justification we have for the beliefs produced in this way.
Premise 3 is far more controversial. Field defends this premise by
observing that “the truth-values of our mathematical assertions
depend on facts involving platonic entities that reside in a realm
outside of space-time” (Field 1989, p. 68) and thus are causally
isolated from us even in principle. However, this defense assumes that
any adequate explanation of the reliability in question must involve
some causal correlation. This has been challenged by a variety of
philosophers who have proposed more minimal explanations of the
reliability claim. (See Burgess & Rosen 1997, pp. 41–49 and
Lewis 1991, pp. 111–112; cf. also Clarke-Doane 2016. See Linnebo
2006 for a 
critique.)[13]
Another famous article by Benacerraf develops a metaphysical objection
to mathematical platonism (Benacerraf 1965, cf. also Kitcher
1978). Although Benacerraf focuses on arithmetic, the objection
naturally generalizes to most pure mathematical objects.
Benacerraf opens by defending what is now known as a structuralist
view of the natural numbers, according to which the natural numbers
have no properties other than those they have in virtue of being
positions in an ω-sequence. For instance, there is nothing more
to being the number 3 than having certain intrastructurally defined
relational properties, such as succeeding 2, being half of 6, and being
prime. No matter how hard we study arithmetic and set theory, we will
never know whether 3 is identical with the fourth von Neumann ordinal,
or with the corresponding Zermelo ordinal, or perhaps, as Frege
suggested, with the class of all three-membered classes (in some system
that allows such classes to exist).
Benacerraf now draws the following conclusion:
In other words, Benacerraf claims that there can be no objects which
have nothing but structural properties. All objects must have some
non-structural properties as well. (See Benacerraf 1996 for some
later reflections on this argument.)
Both of the steps of Benacerraf’s argument are
controversial. The first step—that natural numbers have only
structural properties—has recently been defended by a variety of
mathematical structuralists (Parsons 1990, Resnik 1997, and Shapiro
1997). But this step is denied by logicists and neo-logicists, who
claim that the natural numbers are intrinsically tied to the
cardinalities of the collections that they number. And the second
step—that there can be no objects with only structural
properties—is explicitly rejected by all of the structuralists
who defend the first step. (For some voices sympathetic to the second
step, see Hellman 2001 and MacBride 2005. See also Linnebo 2008 for
discussion.)
In addition to Benacerraf’s, a variety of metaphysical objections to
mathematical platonism have been developed. One of the more famous
examples is an argument of Nelson Goodman’s against set
theory. Goodman (1956) defends the Principle of Nominalism,
which states that whenever two entities have the same basic
constituents, they are identical. This principle can be regarded as a
strengthening of the familiar set theoretic axiom of
extensionality. The axiom of extensionality states that if two
sets x and y have the same elements—that is,
if ∀u(u ∈ x ↔ u
∈ y)—then they are identical. The Principle of
Nominalism is obtained by replacing the membership relation with its
transitive
 closure.[14]
 The principle thus states that if x and y are borne
∈* by the same individuals—that is,
if ∀u(u ∈* x ↔ u ∈*
y)—then x and y are identical. By
endorsing this principle, Goodman disallows the formation of sets and
classes, allowing only the formation of mereological sums and the
application to the standard mereological operations (as described by
his “calculus of individuals”).
However, Goodman’s defense of the Principle of Nominalism is now
widely held to be unconvincing, as witnessed by the widespread
acceptance by philosophers and mathematicians of set theory as a
legitimate and valuable branch of mathematics.
Object realism says there exist abstract mathematical objects,
whereas platonism adds Independence, which says that mathematical
objects are independent of intelligent agents and their language,
thought, and practices. This final section
surveys some lightweight forms of object realism that stop short of full-fledged platonism.
A natural gloss on Independence is the counterfactual
conditional that, had there not been any intelligent agents, or had
their language, thought, or practices been suitably different, there
would still have been mathematical objects.



This counterfactual independence (as we may call it) is accepted by
most analytic philosophers. To see why, consider the role that
mathematics plays in our reasoning. We often reason about scenarios
that aren’t actual. Were we to build a bridge across this canyon, say,
how strong would it have to be to withstand the powerful gusts of
wind? Sadly, the previous bridge collapsed. Would it have done so had
the steel girders been twice as thick? This form of reasoning about
counterfactual scenarios is indispensable both to our everyday
deliberations and to science. The permissibility of such reasoning has
an important consequence. Since the truths of pure mathematics can
freely be appealed to throughout our counterfactual reasoning, it
follows that these truths are counterfactually independent of us
humans, and all other intelligent life for that matter. That is, had
been there been no intelligent life, these truths would still have
remained the same. 


Pure mathematics is in this respect very different from ordinary
empirical truths. Had intelligent life never existed, this article
would not have been written. More interestingly, pure mathematics also
contrasts with various social conventions and constructions, with
which it is sometimes compared (Cole 2009, Feferman 2009, Hersh
1997). Had intelligent life never existed, there would have been no
laws, contracts, or marriages—yet the mathematical truths would
have remained the same. 


Thus, if Independence is understood merely as counterfactual
independence, then anyone who accepts object realism should also
accept platonism. 


It is doubtful that this understanding of Independence is
sufficient, however. For Independence is meant to substantiate
an analogy between mathematical objects and ordinary physical
objects. Just as electrons and planets exist independently of us, so
do numbers and sets. And just as statements about electrons and
planets are made true or false by the objects with which they are
concerned and these objects’ perfectly objective properties, so are
statements about numbers and sets. In short, mathematical objects are
just as “real” as ordinary physical objects (if not even more so, as
Plato thought). 


Let us now consider some views that reject this stronger understanding
of Independence in terms of the mentioned analogy. These views
are thus lightweight forms of object realism, which stop short of
full-blown platonism. 
4.2 Plenitudious platonism


One lightweight form of object realism is the “full-blooded
platonism” of Balaguer 1998. This view is characterized by
a plenitude principle to the effect that any mathematical
objects that could exist actually do exist. For instance, since the
Continuum Hypothesis is independent of the standard axiomatization of
set theory, there is a universe of sets in which the hypothesis is
true and another in which it is false. And neither universe is
metaphysically privileged. By contrast, traditional platonism asserts
that there is a unique universe of sets in which the Continuum
Hypothesis is either determinately true or determinately
false.[15]


One alleged benefit of this plenitudinous view is in the
epistemology of mathematics. If every consistent mathematical theory is
true of some universe of mathematical objects, then mathematical
knowledge will, in some sense, be easy to obtain: provided that our
mathematical theories are consistent, they are guaranteed to be true of
some universe of mathematical objects.


However, “full-blooded platonism” has received much
criticism. Colyvan and Zalta 1999 criticize it for undermining the
possibility of reference to mathematical objects, and Restall 2003,
for lacking a precise and coherent formulation of the plenitude
principle on which the view is based. Martin (2001) proposes that
different universes of sets be amalgamated to yield a single maximal
universe, which will be privileged by fitting our conception of set
better than any other universe of sets.


A different version of plenitudinous platonism is developed in Linsky
& Zalta 1995 and a series of further articles. (See, for instance,
Linsky & Zalta 2006 and other articles cited therein.)
Traditional platonism goes wrong by “conceiv[ing] of abstract
objects on the model of physical objects” (Linsky & Zalta

4.3 Lightweight semantic values

Classical Semantics. These assumptions ensure that the singular
terms and quantifiers of mathematical language refer to and range over
abstract objects. Given these assumptions, should one also be a
mathematical platonist? In other words, do the objects that mathematical

to make some definite contribution to the truth-values of sentences in

If some lightweight account of semantic values is defensible, we can
