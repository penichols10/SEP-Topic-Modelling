Belief revision (belief change, belief dynamics) has been recognized
as a subject of its own since the middle of the 1980s. It grew out of
two converging research traditions.
One of these emerged in computer science. Since the beginning of
computing, programmers have developed procedures by which databases
can be updated. The development of Artificial Intelligence inspired
computer scientists to construct more sophisticated models of database
updating. The truth maintenance systems developed by Jon Doyle (1979)
were important in this development. One of the most significant
theoretical contributions was a 1983 paper by Ronald Fagin, Jeffrey
Ullman and Moshe Vardi, in which they introduced the notion of
database priorities. 
The second of these two research traditions is philosophical. In a
wide sense, belief change has been a subject of philosophical
reflection since antiquity. In the twentieth century, philosophers
have discussed the mechanisms by which scientific theories develop,
and they have proposed criteria of rationality for revisions of
probability assignments. Beginning in the 1970s, a more focused
discussion has taken place on the requirements of rational belief
change. Two milestones can be pointed out. The first was a series of
studies conducted by Isaac Levi in the 1970s (Levi 1977, 1980). Levi
posed many of the problems that have since then been major concerns in
this field of research. He also provided much of the basic formal
framework. William Harper’s (1977) work from the same period has
also had a lasting influence. 
The next milestone was the AGM model, so called after its three
originators, Carlos Alchourrón, Peter Gärdenfors, and
David Makinson (1985). Alchourrón and Makinson had previously
cooperated in studies of changes in legal codes (Alchourrón and
Makinson 1981, 1982). Gärdenfors’s early work was concerned
with the connections between belief change and conditional sentences
(Gärdenfors 1978, 1981). With combined forces the three wrote a
paper that provided a new, much more general and versatile formal
framework for studies of belief change. (On the history of their joint
work, see Makinson 2003 and Gärdenfors 2011.) Since the paper was
published in the Journal of Symbolic Logic in 1985, its major
concepts and constructions have been the subject of significant
elaboration and development. The AGM model and developments that have
grown out of it still form the core of belief revision theory.
In the AGM model and most other models of belief change, beliefs are
represented by sentences in some formal language. Sentences do not
capture all aspects of belief, but they are the best general-purpose
representation that is presently available.
The beliefs held by an agent are represented by a set of such
belief-representing sentences. It is usually assumed that this set is
closed under logical consequence, i.e., every sentence that follows
logically from this set is already in the set. This is clearly an
unrealistic idealization, since it means that the agent is taken to be
“logically omniscient”, i.e. a perfect logical reasoner.
However, it is a useful idealization since it simplifies the logical
treatment; indeed, it seems difficult to obtain an interesting formal
treatment without it. In logic, logically closed sets are called
“theories”. In formal epistemology they are also called
“corpora”, “knowledge sets”, or (more
commonly) “belief sets”.
Isaac Levi (1991) has clarified the nature of this idealization by
pointing out that a belief set consists of the sentences that someone
is committed to believe, not those that she actually
believes in. According to Levi, we are doxastically committed to
believe in all the logical consequences of our beliefs, but typically
our performance does not live up to this commitment. The belief set is
the set of the agent’s epistemic commitments, and therefore
larger than the set of her actually held beliefs.
In the AGM framework, there are three types of belief change. In
contraction, a specified sentence \(p\) is removed, i.e., a
belief set \(K\) is superseded by another belief set \(K\div p\) that
is a subset of \(K\) not containing \(p\). In expansion a
sentence \(p\) is added to \(K\), and nothing is removed, i.e. \(K\)
is replaced by a set \(K+p\) that is the smallest logically closed set
that contains both \(K\) and \(p\). In revision a sentence
\(p\) is added to \(K\), and at the same time other sentences are
removed if this is needed to ensure that the resulting belief set \(K*
p\) is consistent.
It is important to note the specific character of these models. They
are input-assimilating. This means that the object of change,
the belief set, is exposed to an input, and is changed as a result of
this. No explicit representation of time is included. Instead, the
characteristic mathematical constituent is a function that, to each
pair of a belief set and an input, assigns a new belief set.
The belief-representing sentences form a language. (As is usual in
logic, the language is identified with the set of all sentences it
contains.) Sentences, i.e. elements of this language, will be
represented by lowercase letters \((p, q\ldots)\) and sets of
sentences by capital letters. This language contains the usual
truth-functional connectives: negation \((\neg)\), conjunction
\((\amp)\), disjunction \((\vee)\), implication \((\rightarrow)\), and
equivalence (\(\leftrightarrow\)). \(\smbot\) denotes an arbitrary
contradiction (“falsum”), and \(\smtop\) an arbitrary
tautology.
To express the logic, a Tarskian consequence operator will be
used. Intuitively speaking, for any set \(A\) of sentences, \(\Cn(A)\)
is the set of logical consequences of \(A\). More formally, a
consequence operation on a given language is a function \(\Cn\) from
sets of sentences to sets of sentences. It satisfies the following
three conditions:
Inclusion:

\(A\subseteq \Cn(A)\)
Monotony:

If \(A\subseteq B\), then \(\Cn(A) \subseteq \Cn(B)\)
Iteration:

\(\Cn(A) = \Cn(\Cn(A))\)
\(\Cn\) is assumed to be supraclassical, i.e. if \(p\) can be derived
from \(A\) by classical truth-functional logic, then \(p \in \Cn(A)\).
\(A\) is a belief set if and only if \(A = \Cn(A)\). In what follows,
\(K\) will denote a belief set. \(X \vdash p\) is an alternative
notation for \(p \in \Cn(X)\), and \(X \not\vdash p\) for \(p \not\in
\Cn(X)\). \(\Cn(\varnothing)\) is the set of tautologies.
The expansion of \(K\) by a sentence \(p\), i.e. the operation that
just adds \(p\) and removes nothing, is denoted \(K+p\) and defined as
follows: \(K+p = \Cn(K\cup \{p\})\).
The outcome of contracting \(K\) by \(p\) should be a subset of \(K\)
that does not imply \(p\), but from which no elements of \(K\) have
been unnecessarily removed. Therefore, it is of interest to consider
the inclusion-maximal subsets of \(K\) that do not imply \(p\).
For any set \(A\) and sentence \(p\) the remainder set
\(A\bot p\) (“\(A\) remainder \(p\)”) is the set of
inclusion-maximal subsets of \(A\) that do not imply \(p\). In other
words, a set \(B\) is an element of \(A\bot p\) if and only if it it
is a subset of \(A\) that does not imply \(p\), and there is no set
\(B'\) not implying \(p\) such that \(B\subset B'\subseteq A\). The
elements of \(A\bot p\) are called “remainders”.
If the operation of contraction uncompromisingly minimizes information
loss, then \(K\div p\) will be one of the remainders. However, this
construction can be shown to have implausible properties. A more
reasonable recipe for contraction is to let \(K\div p\) be the
intersection of some of the remainders. This is partial meet
contraction, the major innovation in the classic 1985 paper by
Carlos Alchourrón, Peter Gärdenfors and David Makinson. An
operation of partial meet contraction employs a selection
function that selects the “best” elements of \(K\bot
p\). More precisely, a selection function for \(K\) is a function
\(\gamma\) such that if \(K\bot p\) is non-empty, then \(\gamma(K\bot
p)\) is a non-empty subset of \(K\bot p\). In the limiting case when
\(K\bot p\) is empty, then \(\gamma(K\bot p)\) is defined to be equal
to \(\{K\}\).
The outcome of the partial meet contraction is equal to the
intersection of the set of selected elements of \(K\bot p\), i.e.
\(K\div p = \bigcap \gamma(K\bot p)\).
The limiting case when for all sentences \(p\), \(\gamma(K\bot p)\)
has exactly one element is called maxichoice contraction. The
other limiting case in which \(\gamma(K\bot p) = K\bot p\) whenever
\(K\bot p\) is non-empty is called full meet contraction.
Both limiting cases are technically useful, but they also both have
highly unrealistic properties.
Partial meet contraction of a belief set satisfies six postulates that
are called the basic Gärdenfors postulates (or basic AGM
postulates). To begin with, when a belief set \(K\) is contracted by a
sentence \(p\), the outcome should be logically closed.
Closure:

\(K\div p = \Cn(K\div p)\) 
Contraction should be successful, i.e., \(K\div p\) should not imply
\(p\) (or not contain \(p\), which is the same thing if Closure is
satisfied). However, it would be too much to require that \(p \not\in
\Cn(K\div p)\) for all sentences \(p\), since it cannot hold if \(p\)
is a tautology. The success postulate has to be conditional on \(p\)
not being logically true.
Success:

If \(p \not\in \Cn(\varnothing)\), then \(p \not\in \Cn(K\div p)\).
The Success postulate has been put in doubt since there may be
sentences other than tautologies that an epistemic agent may refuse to
withdraw. (On operations that do not satisfy Success, see Section
6.5.)
The contracted set is assumed to be a subset of the original one:
Inclusion:

\(K\div p \subseteq K\) 
Inclusion is usually considered to be a constitutive property of
contraction. However, it has also been questioned with the argument
that when the epistemic agent ceases to believe in \(p\), then this is
usually because she receives some new information that contradicts
\(p\). Arguably, that information should be included in \(K\div p\).
If the sentence to be contracted is not included in the original
belief set, then contraction by that sentence involves no change at
all. Such contractions are idle (vacuous) operations, and they should
leave the original set unchanged.
Vacuity:

If \(p \not\in \Cn(K)\), then \(K\div p = K\). 
Logically equivalent sentences should be treated alike in
contraction:
Extensionality:

If \(p\leftrightarrow q \in \Cn(\varnothing)\), then \(K\div p = K\div
q\). 
Extensionality guarantees that the logic of contraction is extensional
in the sense of allowing logically equivalent sentences to be freely
substituted for each other.
Belief contraction should not only be successful, it should also be
minimal in the sense of leading to the loss of as few
previous beliefs as possible. The epistemic agent should give up
beliefs only when forced to do so, and should then give up as few of
them as possible. This is ensured by the following postulate:
Recovery:

\(K \subseteq (K\div p)+p\) 
According to Recovery, so much is retained after \(p\) has been
removed that everything will be recovered by reinclusion (through
expansion) of \(p\).
One of the central results about the AGM model is a representation
theorem for partial meet contraction. According to this theorem, an
operation \(\div\) is a partial meet contraction for a belief set
\(K\) if and only if it satisfies the six above-mentioned postulates,
namely Closure, Success, Inclusion, Vacuity, Extensionality, and
Recovery.
A selection function for a belief set \(K\) should, for all sentences
\(p\), select those elements of \(K\bot p\) that are
“best”, or most worth retaining. However, the definition
of a selection function is very general, and allows for quite
disorderly selection patterns. An orderly selection function should
always choose the best element(s) of the remainder set according to
some well-behaved preference relation. A selection function \(\gamma\)
for a belief set \(K\) is relational if and only if there is
a binary relation \(\mathbf{R}\) such that for all sentences \(p\), if
\(K\bot p\) is non-empty, then \(\gamma(K\bot p) = \{B \in K\bot p
\mid C\mathbf{R}B\) for all \(C \in K\bot p\}\). Furthermore, if
\(\mathbf{R}\) is transitive (i.e., it satisfies: If \(A\mathbf{R}B\)
and \(B\mathbf{R}C\), then \(A\mathbf{R}C)\), then \(\gamma\) and the
partial meet contraction that it gives rise to are transitively
relational.
In order to characterize transitively relational partial meet
contraction, postulates are needed that refer to contraction by
conjunctions.
In order to give up a conjunction \(p \amp q\), the agent must
relinquish either her belief in \(p\) or her belief in \(q\) (or
both). Suppose that contracting by \(p \amp q\) leads to loss of the
belief in \(p\), i.e., that \(p \not\in K\div(p \amp q)\). It can be
expected that in this case contraction by \(p \amp q\) should lead to
the loss of all beliefs that would have been lost in order to contract
by \(p\). Another way to express this is that everything that is
retained in \(K\div(p \amp q)\) is also retained in \(K\div p\):
Conjunctive inclusion:

If \(p \not\in K\div(p \amp q)\), then \(K\div(p \amp q) \subseteq
K\div p\). 
Another fairly reasonable principle for contraction by conjunctions is
that whatever can withstand both contraction by \(p\) and contraction
by \(q\) can also withstand contraction by \(p \amp q\). In other
words, whatever is an element of both \(K\div p\) and \(K\div q\) is
also an element of \(K\div(p \amp q)\).
Conjunctive overlap:

\((K\div p) \cap (K\div q) \subseteq K\div(p \amp q)\) 
Conjunctive overlap and Conjunctive inclusion are commonly called
Gärdenfors’s supplementary postulates for belief
contraction. An operation \(\div\) for \(K\) is a transitively
relational partial meet contraction if and only if it satisfies the
six basic postulates and in addition both Conjunctive overlap and
Conjunctive inclusion.
When forced to give up previous beliefs, the epistemic agent should
give up beliefs that have as little explanatory power and overall
informational value as possible. As an example of this, in the choice
between giving up beliefs in natural laws and beliefs in single
factual statements, beliefs in the natural laws, that have much higher
explanatory power, should in general be retained. This was the basic
idea behind Peter Gärdenfors’s proposal that contraction of
beliefs should be ruled by a binary relation, epistemic
entrenchment. (Gärdenfors 1988, Gärdenfors and Makinson
1988) To say of two elements \(p\) and \(q\) of the belief set that
“\(q\) is more entrenched than \(p\)” means that \(q\) is
more useful in inquiry or deliberation, or has more “epistemic
value” than \(p\). In belief contraction, the beliefs with the
lowest entrenchment should be the ones that are most readily given
up.
The following symbols will be used for epistemic entrenchment:
\(p\le q : p\) is at most as entrenched as \(q\).
\(p\lt q : p\) is less entrenched than \(q\). \(((p\le q) \amp
\neg(q\le p)))\)
\(p\equiv q : p\) and \(q\) are equally entrenched. \(((p\le q)
\amp(q\le p))\)
Gärdenfors has proposed the following five postulates for
epistemic entrenchment. They are often referred to as the standard
postulates for entrenchment:
Transitivity:

If \(p\le q\) and \(q\le r\), then \(p\le r\).
Dominance:

If \(p \vdash q\), then \(p\le q\).
Conjunctiveness:

Either \(p\le(p \amp q)\) or \(q\le(p \amp q)\).
Minimality:

If the belief set \(K\) is consistent, then \(p \not\in K\) if and
only if \(p\le q\) for all \(q\).
Maximality:

If \(q\le p\) for all \(q\), then \(p \in \Cn(\varnothing)\).
It follows from the first three of these postulates that an
entrenchment relation satisfies connectivity (completeness), i.e. it
holds for all \(p\) and \(q\) that either \(p\le q\) or \(q\le
p\).
An entrenchment relation \(\le\) gives rise to an operation \(\div\)
of entrenchment-based contraction according to the following
definition:
\(q \in K\div p\) if and only if \(q \in K\) and either \(p \lt(p \vee
q)\) or \(p \in \Cn(\varnothing)\). 
Entrenchment-based contraction has been shown to coincide exactly with
transitively relational partial meet contraction. For a thorough
discussion and more results on entrenchment relations, see Rott
2001.
Recovery is the most debated postulate of belief change. It is easy to
find examples that seem to validate Recovery. A person who first loses
and then regains her belief that she has a dollar in her pocket seems
to return to her previous state of belief. However, other examples can
also be presented, in which Recovery yields implausible results. The
following are two of the examples that have been offered to show that
Recovery does not hold in general:
I have read in a book about Cleopatra that she had both a son and a
daughter. My set of beliefs therefore contains both \(p\) and \(q\),
where \(p\) denotes that Cleopatra had a son and \(q\) that she had a
daughter. I then learn from a knowledgeable friend that the book is in
fact a historical novel. After that I contract \(p\vee q\) from my set
of beliefs, i.e., I do not any longer believe that Cleopatra had a
child. Soon after that, however, I learn from a reliable source that
Cleopatra had a child. It seems perfectly reasonable for me to then
add \(p\vee q\) to my set of beliefs without also reintroducing either
\(p\) or \(q\). This contradicts Recovery.
I previously entertained the two beliefs “George is a
criminal” \((p)\) and “George is a mass murderer”
\((q)\). When I received information that induced me to give up the
first of these beliefs \((p)\), the second \((q)\) had to go as well
(since \(p\) would otherwise follow from \(q)\).
I then received new information that made me accept the belief
“George is a shoplifter” \((r)\). The resulting new belief
set is the expansion of \(K\div p\) by \(r\), \((K\div p)+r.\) Since
\(p\) follows from \(r\), \((K\div p)+p\) is a subset of \((K\div
p)+r\). By recovery, \((K\div p)+p\) includes \(q\), from which
follows that \((K\div p)+r\) includes \(q\).
Thus, since I previously believed George to be a mass murderer, it
follows from Recovery that I cannot after that believe him to be a
shoplifter without believing him to be a mass murderer.
Due to the problematic nature of this postulate, it should be
interesting to find intuitively less controversial postulates that
prevent unnecessary losses in contraction. The following is an attempt
to do that:
Core-retainment:

If \(q \in K\) and \(q \not\in K\div p\), then there is a belief set
\(K'\) such that \(K' \subseteq K\) and that \(p \not\in K'\) but \(p
\in K'+q\). 
Core-retainment requires of an excluded sentence \(q\) that it in some
way contributes to the fact that \(K\) implies \(p\). It gives the
impression of being weaker and more plausible than Recovery. However,
it has been shown that if an operator \(\div\) for a belief set \(K\)
satisfies Core-retainment, then it satisfies Recovery.
Attempts have been made to construct operations of contraction on
belief sets that do not satisfy Recovery. Arguably, the most plausible
of these constructions is the operation of severe withdrawal
that has been thoroughly investigated by Hans Rott and Maurice
Pagnucco (2000). It can be constructed from an operation of epistemic
entrenchment by modifying the definition as follows:
\(q \in K\div p\) if and only if \(q \in K\) and either \(p \lt q\) or
\(p \in \Cn(\varnothing)\). 
Severe withdrawal has interesting features, but it also has the
following property:
Expulsiveness:

If \(p \not\in \Cn(\varnothing)\) and \(q \not\in \Cn(\varnothing)\)
then either \(p \not\in K\div q\) or \(q \not\in K\div p\). 
This is a highly implausible property of belief contraction, since it
does not allow unrelated beliefs to be undisturbed by each
other’s contraction. Consider a scholar who believes that her
car is parked in front of the house. She also believes that
Shakespeare wrote the Tempest. It should be possible for her to give
up the first of these beliefs while retaining the second. She should
also be able to give up the second without giving up the first.
Expulsiveness does not allow this. The construction of a plausible
operation of contraction for belief sets that does not satisfy
Recovery is still an open issue.
The two major tasks of an operation \(*\) of revision are (1) to add
the new belief \(p\) to the belief set \(K\), and (2) to ensure that
the resulting belief set \(K* p\) is consistent (unless \(p\) is
inconsistent). The first task can be accomplished by expansion by
\(p\). The second can be accomplished by prior contraction by its
negation \(\neg p\). If a belief set does not imply \(\neg p\), then
\(p\) can be added to it without loss of consistency. This composition
of suboperations gives rise to the following definition of revision
(Gärdenfors 1981, Levi 1977):
Levi identity:

\(K* p = (K\div \neg p)+p\). 
If \(\div\) is a partial meet contraction, then the operation \(*\)
that is defined in this way is a partial meet revision. This
is the standard construction of revision in the AGM model.
Partial meet revision has been axiomatically characterized. An
operation \(*\) is a partial meet revision if and only if it satisfies
the following six postulates:
Closure:

\(K* p = \Cn(K* p)\)
Success:

\(p \in K* p\)
Inclusion:

\(K* p \subseteq K+p\)
Vacuity:

If \(\neg p \not\in K\), then \(K* p = K+p\).
Consistency:

\(K* p\) is consistent if \(p\) is consistent.
Extensionality:

If \((p \leftrightarrow q) \in \Cn(\varnothing)\), then \(K* p = K*
q\).
These six postulates are commonly called the basic Gärdenfors
postulates for revision. The most controversial of them is
Success. It implies that in response to an inconsistent input
sentence, the epistemic agent will acquire an inconsistent belief set,
according to which she holds all sentences to be true. Even for
consistent input sentences, Success is contestable. It is not
implausible for an epistemic agent to consider some statements to be
so implausible that nothing can make her believe in them. For belief
revision models that do not satisfy Success, see section 6.3. and
6.4.
The following two supplementary postulates are parts of the standard
repertoire:
Superexpansion:

\(K* (p \amp q) \subseteq(K* p)+q\)
Subexpansion:

If \(\neg q \not\in \Cn(K* p)\), then \((K* p)+q \subseteq K* (p \amp
q)\).
These postulates are closely related to the supplementary postulates
for contraction. Let \(*\) be the partial meet revision defined from
the partial meet contraction \(\div\) via the Levi identity. Then
\(*\) satisfies superexpansion if and only if \(\div\) satisfies
conjunctive overlap. Furthermore, \(*\) satisfies subexpansion if and
only if \(\div\) satisfies conjunctive inclusion.
The following postulate was introduced by Hans Rott:
Disjunctive factoring:

\(K* (p\vee q) \) is equal to one of \(K* p\), \(K* q\), and \(K*
p\cap K* q\).
Rott showed that in the presence of the six basic AGM postulates, the
two supplementary AGM postulates, Superexpansion and Subexpansion,
both hold if and only if Disjunctive factoring holds.
Alternative models of belief states can be constructed out of sets of
possible worlds (Grove 1988). In logical parlance, by a possible
world is meant a maximal consistent subset of the language. By a
proposition is meant a set of possible worlds. There is a
one-to-one correspondence between propositions and belief sets. Each
belief set can be represented by the proposition (set of possible
worlds) that consists of those possible worlds that contain the belief
set in question.
For any set \(A\) of sentences, let \([A]\) denote the set of possible
worlds that contain \(A\) as a subset, and similarly for any sentence
\(p\) let \([p]\) be the set of possible worlds that contain \(p\) as
an element. If \(A\) is inconsistent, then \([A] = \varnothing\).
Otherwise, \([A]\) is a non-empty set of possible worlds. (It is
assumed that \(\bigcap \varnothing\) is equal to the whole language.)
If \(K\) is a belief set, then \(\bigcap[K] = K\).
The propositional account provides an intuitively clear picture of
some aspects of belief change. It is convenient to use a geometrical
surface to represent the set of possible worlds. In Diagram
1, every point on the rectangle’s surface represents a
possible world. The circle marked \([K]\) represents those possible
worlds in which all sentences in \(K\) are true, i.e., the set \([K]\)
of possible worlds. The area marked \([p]\) represents those possible
worlds in which the sentence \(p\) is true.
Diagram 1. Revision of \(K\) by
\(p\).
In Diagram 1, \([K]\) and \([p]\) have a non-empty
intersection, which means that \(K\) is compatible with \(p\). The
revision of \(K\) by \(p\) is therefore not belief-contravening. Its
outcome is obtained by giving up those elements of \([K]\) that are
incompatible with \(p\). In other words, the result of revising
\([K]\) by \([p]\) should be equal to \([K]\cap[p]\).
If \([K]\) and \([p]\) do not intersect, then the outcome of the
revision must be sought outside of \([K]\), but it should nevertheless
be a subset of \([p]\). In general:
The outcome of revising \([K]\) by \([p]\) is a subset of \([p]\) that
is
This simple rule for revision can be shown to correspond exactly
to partial meet revision.
The revised belief state should not differ more from the original
belief state \([K]\) than what is motivated by \([p]\). This can be
achieved by requiring that the outcome of revising \([K]\) by \([p]\)
consists of those elements of \([p]\) that are as close as possible to
\([K]\). For that purpose, \([K]\) can be thought of as surrounded by
a system of concentric spheres (just as in David Lewis’s account
of counterfactual conditionals). Each sphere represents a degree of
closeness or similarity to \([K]\).
In this model, the outcome of revising \([K]\) by \([p]\) should be
the intersection of \([p]\) with the narrowest sphere around \([K]\)
that has a non-empty intersection with \([p]\), as in Diagram
2. This construction was invented by Adam Grove (1988), who also
proved that such sphere-based revision corresponds exactly to
transitively relational partial meet revision. It follows that it
also corresponds exactly to entrenchment-based revision.
Diagram 2. Sphere-based revision of
\(K\) by \(p\).
Possible world models can also be used for contraction. In
contraction, a restriction on what worlds are “possible”
(compatible with the agent’s beliefs) is removed. Thus, the set
of possibilities is enlarged, so that the contraction of \([K]\) by
\([p]\) will result in a superset of \([K]\). Furthermore, the new
possibilities should be worlds in which \(p\) does not hold, i.e.,
they should be worlds in which \(\neg p\) holds. In the limiting case
when \([K]\) and \([\neg p]\) have a non-empty intersection, no
enlargement of \([K]\) is necessary to make \(\neg p\) possible, and
the original belief state will therefore be unchanged. In summary,
contraction should be performed according to the following rule:
The outcome of contracting \([K]\) by \([p]\) is the union of \([K]\)
and a subset of \([\neg p]\) that is
Belief-contravening contraction is illustrated in Diagram 3.
Contraction performed according to this rule can be shown to
correspond exactly to partial meet contraction. Furthermore,
the special case when the whole of \([\neg p]\) is added to \([K]\)
corresponds exactly to full meet contraction. The other
extreme case, when only one element of \([\neg p]\) (a
“point” on the surface) is added to \([K]\)
corresponds exactly to maxichoice contraction. Thus, in
maxichoice contraction by \(p\) only one possible way in which \(p\)
can be false \((\neg p\) can be true) is added.
Diagram 3. Contraction of \(K\) by
\(p\).
Grove’s sphere systems can also be used for contraction. In
sphere-based contraction by \(p\), those elements of \([\neg p]\) are
added that belong to the closest sphere around \([K]\) that has a
non-empty intersection with \([\neg p]\). The procedure is shown in
Diagram 4. Sphere-based contraction corresponds exactly
to transitively relational partial meet contraction.
Diagram 4. Sphere-based contraction of
\(K\) by \(p\).
In the approaches discussed above, all beliefs in the belief set are
treated equally in the sense that they are all taken seriously as
beliefs in their own right. However, due to logical closure the belief
set contains many elements that are not really worth to be taken
seriously. Hence, suppose that the belief set contains the sentence
\(p\), “Shakespeare wrote Hamlet”. Due to logical closure
it then also contains the sentence \(p \vee q\), “Either
Shakespeare wrote Hamlet or Charles Dickens wrote Hamlet”. The
latter sentence is a “mere logical consequence” that
should have no standing of its own.
Belief bases have been introduced to capture this feature of the
structure of human beliefs. A belief base is a set of sentences that
is not (except as a limiting case) closed under logical consequence.
Its elements represent beliefs that are held independently of any
other belief or set of beliefs. Those elements of the belief set that
are not in the belief base are “merely derived”, i.e.,
they have no independent standing. In this way, models employing
belief bases can be said to achieve a somewhat higher degree of
affinity to natural-language doxastic reasoning than what seems to be
achievable in models such as AGM that use belief sets as
representations of belief sets. (A still higher degree of affinity to
natural language can be obtained in models employing hyperintensional
logic; see Berto 2019.)
In belief base models, changes are performed on the belief base, which
is not logically closed. The underlying intuition is that the merely
derived beliefs are not worth retaining for their own sake. If one of
them loses the support that it had in basic beliefs, then it will be
automatically discarded.
For every belief base \(A\), there is a belief set \(\Cn(A)\) that
represents the beliefs held according to \(A\). On the other hand, one
and the same belief set can be represented by different belief bases.
In this sense, belief bases have more expressive power than belief
sets. As an example, the two belief bases \(\{p, q\}\) and \(\{p, p
\leftrightarrow q\}\) have the same logical closure. They are
therefore statically equivalent, in the sense of representing
the same beliefs. On the other hand, the following example shows that
they are not dynamically equivalent in the sense of behaving
in the same way under operations of change. They can be taken to
represent different ways of holding the same beliefs.
Let \(p\) denote that the Liberal Party will support the proposal to
subsidize the steel industry, and let \(q\) denote that Ms. Smith, who
is a liberal MP, will vote in favour of that proposal.
Abe has the basic beliefs \(p\) and \(q\), whereas Bob has the basic
beliefs \(p\) and \(p \leftrightarrow q.\) Thus, their beliefs (on the
belief set level) with respect to \(p\) and \(q\) are the same.
Both Abe and Bob receive and accept the information that \(p\) is
wrong, and they both revise their belief states to include the new
belief that \(\neg p\). After that, Abe has the basic beliefs \(\neg
p\) and \(q\), whereas Bob has the basic beliefs \(\neg p\) and \(p
\leftrightarrow q\). Now, their belief sets are no longer the same.
Abe believes that \(q\) whereas Bob believes that \(\neg q\).
(In belief set models, cases like these are taken care of by assuming
that although Abe’s and Bob’s belief states are
represented by the same belief set, this belief set is associated with
different selection mechanisms in the two cases. Abe has a selection
mechanism that gives priority to \(q\) over \(p \leftrightarrow q\),
whereas Bob’s selection mechanism has the opposite
priorities.)
There is only one inconsistent belief set (logically closed
inconsistent set), namely the whole language. On the other hand there
are, in any non-trivial logic, many different inconsistent belief
bases. Therefore, belief bases make it possible to distinguish between
different inconsistent belief states.
In belief revision theory it has mostly been taken for granted that
belief sets correspond to a coherentist epistemology, whereas belief
bases represent foundationalism. However, the logical relationships
among the elements of a logically closed set do not adequately
represent epistemic coherence. Although coherentists typically claim
that all beliefs contribute to the justification of other
beliefs, they hardly mean this to apply to merely derived beliefs such
as “either Paris or Rome is the capital of France”, that
one believes only because one believes Paris to be the capital of
France. Therefore, the distinction between operations on belief bases
and operations on belief sets should not be equated with that between
foundationalism and coherentism.
Partial meet contraction, as defined in Section 2.1, is equally
applicable to belief bases. Note that \(A\bot p\) is the set of
maximal subsets of \(A\) that do not imply \(p\); it is not sufficient
that they do not contain \(p\). Hence 
Most of the basic postulates for partial meet contraction on belief
sets hold for belief bases as well. However, Recovery does not hold
for partial meet contraction of belief bases. This can be seen from
the following example (that is adopted from Isaac Levi (2004) who used
it for other purposes:
Let the belief set \(K\) include both a belief that the coin was
tossed \((c)\) and a belief that it landed heads \((h)\). The
epistemic agent wishes to consider whether, on the supposition that
the coin had been tossed, it would have landed heads. In order to do
that, it would seem reasonable to remove \(c\) from the belief set and
then reinsert it, i.e. to perform the series of operations \(K\div
c+c\).
(1) If partial meet contraction is performed directly on the belief
set, then it follows from Recovery that \(h \in K\div c+c\), i.e.
\(h\) comes back with \(c\). This is contrary to reasonable
intuitions.
(2) If partial meet contraction is instead performed on a belief base
for \(K\), then recovery can be avoided. Let the belief base be
\(\{p_1 ,\ldots ,p_n, c, h\}\), where the background beliefs \(p_1
,\ldots ,p_n\) are unrelated to \(c\) and \(h\), whereas \(h\)
logically implies \(c\). Then \(K = \Cn(\{p_1 ,\ldots ,p_n, c, h\})\).
Since \(h\) implies \(c\), it will have to go when \(c\) is removed,
so that \(K\div c = \Cn(\{p_1 ,\ldots ,p_n\})\). When \(c\) is
reinserted, the outcome is \((K\div c)+c = \Cn(\{p_1 ,\ldots ,p_n,
c\})\) that does not contain \(h\), as desired.
The following representation theorem has been obtained for partial
meet contraction on belief bases (Hansson 1999). An operation \(\div\)
is a partial meet contraction for a set \(A\) if and only if it
satisfies the following four postulates:
Success:

If \(p \not\in \Cn(\varnothing)\), then \(p \not\in \Cn(A\div
p)\).
Inclusion:

\(A\div p \subseteq A\)
Relevance:

If \(q \in A\) and \(q \not\in A\div p\), then there is a set \(A'\)
such that \(A\div p \subseteq A' \subseteq A\) and that \(p \not\in
\Cn(A')\) but \(p \in \Cn(A'\cup \{q\})\).
Uniformity:

If it holds for all subsets \(A'\) of \(A\) that \(p \in \Cn(A')\) if
and only if \(q \in \Cn(A')\), then \(A\div p = A\div q\).
The Relevance postulate has much the same function as Recovery has for
belief sets, namely to prevent unnecessary losses of beliefs.
An alternative approach to contraction of belief bases has been
proposed under the name kernel contraction. For any sentence
\(p\), a \(p\)-kernel is a minimal \(p\)-implying set, i.e. a set that
implies \(p\) but has no proper subset that implies \(p\). A
contraction operation \(\div\) can be based on the simple principle
that no \(p\)-kernel should be included in \(A\div p\). This can be
obtained with an incision function, a function that selects at least
one element from each \(p\)-kernel for removal. An operation that
removes exactly those elements that are selected for removal by an
incision function is called a kernel contraction. It turns out that
all partial meet contractions on belief bases are kernel contractions,
but some kernel contractions are not partial meet contractions. In
other words, kernel contraction is a generalization of partial meet
contraction.
The operation of expansion for belief sets, \(K+p = \Cn(K\cup
\{p\})\), was constructed to ensure that the outcome is logically
closed. This is not desirable for belief bases, and therefore
expansion on belief bases must be different from expansion on belief
sets. For any belief base \(A\) and sentence \(p,\) \(A +' p\), the
(non-closing) expansion of \(A\) by \(p\), is the
set \(A\cup \{p\}\).
Just like the corresponding operations for belief sets, revision
operations for belief bases can be constructed out of two
suboperations: expansion by \(p\) and contraction by \(\neg p\).
According to the Levi identity, \((A* p = (A\div \neg p) +' p)\), the
contractive suboperation should take place first. Alternatively, the
two suboperations may take place in reverse order, \(A* p = (A+'p)
\div \neg p\). This latter possibility does not exist for belief sets.
If \(K\cup \{p\}\) is inconsistent, then \(K+p\) is always the same,
namely identical to the whole language, independently of the identity
of \(K\) and of \(p\), so that all distinctions are lost. For belief
bases, this limitation is not present, and thus there are two distinct
ways to obtain revision from contraction and expansion:
Internal revision:

\(A * p = (A \div \neg p) +' p\)
External revision:

\(A * p = (A +' p) \div \neg p\)
Intuitively, external revision by \(p\) is revision with an
intermediate inconsistent state in which both \(p\) and
\(\neg p\) are believed, whereas internal revision has an
intermediate non-committed state in which neither \(p\) nor
\(\neg p\) is believed. External and internal revision differ in their
logical properties, and neither of them can be subsumed under the
other.
A contraction on a belief base gives rise to a contraction on its
corresponding belief set. Let \(A\) be a belief base and \(K =
\Cn(A)\) its corresponding belief set. Furthermore, let \(-\) be a
contraction on \(A\). It gives rise to an operation \(\div\) of
base-generated contraction on \(K\), such that for all
sentences \(p: K\div p = \Cn(A-p)\). Base-generated contraction has
been axiomatically characterized. An operation \(\div\) on a
consistent belief set \(K\) is generated by an operation of partial
meet contraction for some finite base for \(K\) if and only if it
satisfies the following eight postulates:
Closure:

\(K\div p = \Cn(K\div p)\)
Success:

If \(p \not\in \Cn(\varnothing)\), then \(p \not\in \Cn(K\div
p)\).
Inclusion:

\(K\div p \subseteq K\)
Vacuity:

If \(p \not\in \Cn(K)\), then \(K\div p = K\).
Extensionality:

If \(p\leftrightarrow q \in \Cn(\varnothing)\), then \(K\div p = K\div
q\).
Finitude:

There is a finite set \(X\) such that for every sentence \(p\),
\(K\div p = \Cn(X')\) for some \(X' \subseteq X\).
Symmetry:

If it holds for all \(r\) that \(K\div r \vdash p\) if and only if
\(K\div r \vdash q\), then \(K\div p = K\div q\).
Conservativity:

If \(K\div q\) is not a subset of \(K\div p\), then there is some
\(r\) such that \(K\div p \subseteq K\div r \not\vdash p\) and \(K\div
r \cup K\div q \vdash p\).
Operations of revision on a belief set can be base-generated in the
same sense as operations of contraction.
The AGM framework has been extended in many ways. Some of these
extensions have introduced new types of operations in addition to the
three standard types in AGM, namely contraction, expansion, and
revision.
There are two types of reasons why the epistemic agent may wish to add
new information to the belief set. One is that she has received new
information about the world, the other that the world has changed. It
is common to reserve the term “revision” for the first of
these types, and use the term “updating” for the second.
The logic of updating differs from that of revision. This can be seen
from the following example:
To begin with, the agent knows that there is either a book on the
table \((p)\) or a magazine on the table \((q)\), but not both.
Case 1: The agent is told that there is a book on the table. She
concludes that there is no magazine on the table. This is
revision.
Case 2: The agent is told that after the first information was given,
a book has been put on the table. In this case she should not conclude
that there is no magazine on the table. This is updating.
One useful approach to updating is to assign time indices to the
sentences, as proposed by Katsuno and Mendelzon (1992). Then the
belief set will not consist of sentences \(p\) but of pairs \(\langle
p,t_1\rangle\) of a sentence \(p\) and a point in time \(t_1\),
signifying that \(p\) holds at \(t_1\). In the book-and-magazine
example, let \(t_1\) denote the point in time that the first statement
refers to, and \(t_2\) the moment when the second information was
given in Case 2. The original belief set contained the pair \(\langle
\neg(p\leftrightarrow q),t_1\rangle\). (\(\neg(p\leftrightarrow q)\)
is the exclusive disjunction of \(p\) and \(q\).) Revision by \(p\)
can be represented by the incorporation of \(\langle p,t_1\rangle\),
and updating by \(p\) by the incorporation of \(\langle p,t_2\rangle\)
into the belief set. It follows quite naturally that \(\langle \neg
q,t_1\rangle\) is implied by the revised belief set but not by the
updated belief set.
If a belief base is inconsistent, then it can be made consistent by
removing enough of its more dispensable elements. This operation is
called consolidation. The consolidation of a belief base \(A\) is
denoted \(A!\). A plausible way to perform consolidation is to
contract by falsum (contradiction), i.e. \(A! = A\div\smbot\).
Unfortunately, this recipe for consolidation of inconsistent belief
bases does not have a plausible counterpart for inconsistent belief
sets. The reason is that since belief revision operates within
classical logic, there is only one inconsistent belief set. Once an
inconsistent belief set has been obtained, all distinctions have been
lost, and consolidation cannot restore them.
By non-prioritized belief change is meant a process in which new
information is received, and weighed against old information, with no
special priority assigned to the new information due to its novelty. A
(modified) revision operation that operates in this way is called a
semi-revision. Semi-revision of \(K\) by a sentence \(p\) can be
denoted \(K?p\). A sentence \(p\) that contradicts previous beliefs is
accepted only if it has more epistemic value than the original beliefs
that contradict it. In that case, enough of the previous sentences are
deleted to make the resulting set consistent. Otherwise, the input is
itself rejected.
One way to construct semi-revision on a belief base \(A\) is to let it
consist of two suboperations:
This amounts to defining semi-revision in terms of expansion and
consolidation:
This identity cannot be used for belief sets. Since all inconsistent
belief sets are identical, an operation ? such that \(K?p = (K+p)!\)
will have the extremely implausible property that if \(\neg p_1 \in
K_1\) and \(\neg p_2 \in K_2\), then \(K_1 ?p_1 = K_2 ?p_2\). However,
other ways to perform semirevision on belief sets have been proposed,
in particular, the following two-step process:
A simple way to apply this recipe is David Makinson’s (1997)
screened revision, in which there is a set \(X\) of potential
core beliefs that are immune to revision. The belief set \(K\) should
be revised by the input sentence \(p\) if \(p\) is consistent with the
set \(X\cap K\) of actual core beliefs, otherwise not. The second step
of screened revision is a revision of \(K\) by \(p\), but with the
restriction that no element of \(X\cap K\) is allowed to be
removed.
Another variant of the same recipe is called credibility-limited
revision. It is based on the assumption that some inputs are
accepted, others not. Those that are accepted form the set C of
credible sentences. If \(p \in\) C, then \(K?p = K* p\). Otherwise,
\(K?p = K\). This construction can be further specified by choosing an
operation of revision and assigning properties to the set C. A variety
of such constructions have been investigated (Hansson et al.
2001).
Selective revision is a generalization of semi-revision. In
semi-revision, the input information is either rejected or fully
accepted. In selective revision, it is possible for only a part of the
input information to be accepted. An operation \(\circ\) of selective
revision can be constructed from a standard revision operation \(*\)
and a transformation function \(f\) from and to sentences:
In the intended cases, \(f(p)\) does not contain any information that
is not contained in \(p\). This is ensured if \(f(p)\) is a logical
consequence of \(p\). By adding further conditions on \(f\), various
additional properties can be obtained for the operation of selective
revision.
The Success postulate of contraction requires that all
non-tautological beliefs are retractable. This is not a fully
realistic requirement, since actual agents are known to have beliefs
of a non-logical nature that nothing can bring them to give up. In
shielded contraction, some non-tautological beliefs cannot be given
up; they are shielded from contraction. Shielded contraction can be
based on an ordinary contraction \(\div\) and a set \(R\) of
retractable sentences. If \(p \in R\), then \(K-p = K\div p\).
Otherwise, \(K-p = K\).
This construction can be further specified by adding various
requirements on the structure of \(R\). Close connections have been
shown to hold between shielded contraction and semi-revision.
(Fermé and Hansson 2001)
By replacement is meant an operation that replaces one sentence by
another in a belief set. It is an operation with two variables, such
that \([p/q]\) replaces \(p\) by \(q\). Hence, \(K[p/q]\) is a belief
set that contains \(q\) but not \(p\).
Replacement aims both at the removal of a sentence \(p\) and the
addition of a sentence \(q\). This amounts to two success conditions,
\(p \not\in K[p/q]\) and \(q \in K[p/q]\). However, these two
conditions cannot both be satisfied without exception. First, just as
for belief contraction, an exception must be made from the first of
them in the case when \(p\) is a tautology and so cannot be removed.
Secondly, the two conditions are not compatible in cases when \(q\)
logically implies \(p\). This can be dealt with by extending the
exception that is provided for in the Success postulate for
contraction from cases when \(p \in \Cn(\varnothing)\) to cases when
\(p \in \Cn(\{q\})\). This gives rise to the following two success
conditions:
Contractive success:

If \(p \not\in \Cn(\{q\})\), then \(p \not\in \Cn(K[p/q]\)).
Revision success:

\(q \in K[p/q]\)
Replacement can be used as a kind of “Sheffer stroke” for
belief revision, i.e. as an operation in terms of which the other
operations can be defined. Contraction by \(p\) can be defined as
\(K[p/\smtop]\) and revision by \(p\) as \(K[\smbot/p]\), where
\(\smbot\) is falsum and \(\smtop\) is tautology. Provided that the
unperformable suboperation of removing the tautology \(\smtop\) is
treated as an empty suboperation, expansion by \(p\) can be defined as
\(K[\smtop/p]\).
If the belief set \(K\) has a finite base, then it can be represented
by a single sentence, namely the conjunction \(k\) of all the elements
of its base. This means that the revision \(K* p\) of a belief set
\(K\) by a sentence \(p\) can be replaced by a revision \(k* p\) of a
sentence by another sentence. If this revision is non-prioritized, we
may treat \(k\) and \(p\) equally, so that \(k* p = p* k\). Such an
operation can be described as the merging of two belief
representations. It can represent a process of conflict resolution
through selective combination of information from two agents or
sources. This operation can also be generalized to the merge of
several elements, representing efforts to combine information from
several agents or sources (Konieczny and Pino Pérez 2011).
By multiple contraction is meant the simultaneous contraction of more
than one sentence. Similarly, multiple revision is revision by more
than one sentence.
There are two major types of multiple contraction. In package
contraction, all elements of the input set are retracted: they
have to go in a package. In choice contraction it suffices to
remove at least one of them. Hence, the success conditions for the two
types of multiple contraction are as follows:
Package success:

If \(B\cap \Cn(\varnothing) = \varnothing\) then \(B\cap \Cn(A\div B)
= \varnothing\)
Choice success:

If \(B\) is not a subset of \(\Cn(\varnothing)\), then \(B\) is not a
subset of \(\Cn(A\div B)\).
Partial meet contraction and kernel contraction can both be
generalized fairly straight-forwardly to both package and choice
variants of multiple contraction.
The construction of package revision gives rise to an interesting
extension of the notion of negation. The reason why contraction by
\(\neg p\) is performed as a suboperation of revision by \(p\) is that
\(p\) can be consistently added to a set if and only if it does not
imply \(\neg p\). It turns out that (in a logic satisfying
compactness) a set \(B\) can be consistently added to another set if
and only if this other set does not imply any element of the set
\(\neg B\), that is defined as follows:
Negation of a set:

\(p \in \neg B\) if and only if \(p\) is either a negation of an
element of \(B\cup \{\smtop\}\) or a disjunction of negations of
elements of \(B\cup \{\smtop\}\). 
Therefore multiple revision can be defined from (package) multiple
contraction and expansion via a generalized Levi identity:
Most of the major AGM-related contraction operations have been
generalized to multiple contraction: multiple partial meet contraction
(Hansson 1989, Fuhrmann and Hansson 1994, Li 1998), multiple kernel
contraction (Fermé et al. 2003), multiple specified
meet contraction (Hansson 2010), and a multiple version of
Grove’s sphere system (Reis and Fermé 2011, Fermé
and Reis 2012).
Most models of belief change are deterministic in the sense
that given a belief set and an input, the resulting belief set is
well-determined. There is no scope for chance in selecting the new
belief set. Clearly, this is not a realistic feature, but it makes the
models much simpler and easier to handle, not least from a
computational point of view. In indeterministic belief
change, the subjection of a specified belief set to a specified input
has more than one admissible outcome.
Indeterministic operations can be constructed as sets of deterministic
operations. Hence, given three revision operations \(* , * '\) and \(*
''\) the set \(\{*\), \(* '\), \(*
''\)\(\}\) can be used as an indeterministic
operation. The success condition is simply:
Lindström and Rabinowicz (1991) constructed indeterministic
contraction by giving up the assumption that epistemic entrenchment
satisfies connectedness. This resulted in Grove’s sphere systems
with “fallbacks” that are not linearly ordered but still
all include the original belief set. Fazio and Baldi (2021) have used
indeterministic contraction in an investigation of algebraic
counterparts to both the AGM model and some closely related models of
belief change.
Belief revision theory has been almost exclusively developed within
the framework of classical sentential (truth-functional) logic. The
inclusion of non-truthfunctional expressions into the language has
interesting and indeed drastic effects. In particular, this applies to
conditional sentences.
Many types of conditional sentences, such as counterfactual
conditionals, cannot be adequately expressed with truth-functional
implication (material implication). Several formal interpretations of
conditional sentences have been proposed. One of them, namely the
Ramsey test, is particularly well suited to the formal
framework of belief revision. It is based on a suggestion by F. P.
Ramsey that has been further developed by Robert Stalnaker and others
(Stalnaker 1968). The basic idea is that “if \(p\) then
\(q\)” is taken to be believed if and only if \(q\) would be
believed after revising the present belief state by \(p\). Let
\(p\Rightarrow q\) denote “if \(p\) then \(q\)”, or more
precisely: “if \(p\) were the case, then \(q\) would be the
case”. In order to treat conditional statements on par with
statements about actual facts, they will have to be included in the
belief set, thus:
The Ramsey test:

\((p\Rightarrow q) \in K\) if and only if \(q \in K* p\). 
However, inclusion in the belief set of conditionals that satisfy the
Ramsey test will require radical changes in the logic of belief
change. As one example of this, contraction cannot then satisfy the
inclusion postulate \((K\div p \subseteq K)\). The reason for this is
that contraction typically provides support for conditional sentences
that were not supported by the original belief state. This can be seen
from the following example:
If I give up my belief that John is mentally retarded, then I gain
support for the conditional sentence “If John has lived 30 years
in London, then John understands the English language.” 
A famous impossibility theorem by Peter Gärdenfors (1986, 1987)
shows that the Ramsey test is incompatible with a set of plausible
postulates for revision. Several solutions to the impossibility
theorem have been put forward. One option is to reject the Ramsey test
as a criterion for the validity of conditional sentences (Rott 1986).
Another, proposed by Isaac Levi, is to accept the test as a criterion
of validity but deny that such conditional sentences should be
included in the belief set when they are valid (Levi 1988.
Arló-Costa 1995. Arló-Costa and Levi 1996). Several
other proposals have been put forward. However, it is fair to say that
operations of AGM-style belief change have not yet been constructed
that are generally recognized as able to deal adequately with
conditional or modal sentences.
The AGM model and most related models of belief change assume highly
idealized reasoners who have unlimited cognitive capacities. Harman
(1986) developed a set of rationality principles for resource-bounded
epistemic agents. Wassermann (1999), Alechina (2006), Doyle (2013) and
others have developed models of belief change for agents with limited
cognitive capacities. The use of finite belief bases (section 5) can
be seen as a way to avoid the operations on infinite belief sets that
are standard in AGM. Operations on infinite sets can require infinite
resources, which makes such operations impossible for agents with
finite resources.
An operation of change can raise or lower the position of a sentence
in the ordering without affecting the belief set (but affecting how
the belief state responds to new inputs). An operation of
improvement, as proposed by Konieczny and Pérez (2008)
increases the plausibility of a non-believed sentence \(p\) by moving
some of the \(p\)-worlds to a higher position in the preference
ordering of worlds. Even if such a change does not lead to \(p\)
becoming a belief, its acceptance in later, additional operations can
be facilitated. 
An operation of change can be so constructed that it adjusts the
position of the input sentence in an ordering to be the same as that
of a reference sentence. This means that two sentences have to be
specified in the input: the (input) sentence to be moved and the
(reference) sentence indicating its new position. Hans Rott (2007,
Other Internet Resources) called such operators two-dimensional. John
Cantwell (1997) classified them as raising or
lowering, depending on the direction of change. (See also
Fermé and Rott 2004 and Rott 2009.)
There are close parallels between changes in norms and changes in
beliefs. In order to apply a norm system with conflicting norms to a
particular situation, some of the norms may have to be ignored. The
problem how to prioritize among conflicting norms is similar to the
selection of sentences for removal in belief contraction (Hansson and
Makinson 1997). The AGM model was in fact partly the outcome of
attempts to formalize changes in norms rather than beliefs
(Alchourrón and Makinson 1981). In spite of this, authors who
apply the AGM model to norms have found it in need of rather extensive
modifications to make it suitable for that purpose. Hence, in their
model of changes in legislation, Governatori and Rotolo (2010)
introduced an explicit representation of time in order to account for
phenomena such as retroactivity.
A model of changes in preferences can be obtained by replacing the
standard AGM language by sentences of the form \(p \ge q\)
(“\(p\) is at least as good as \(q\)”) and their
truth-functional combinations. The adoption of a new preference can
then take the form of revision by such a preference sentence. Partial
meet contraction can be used, but some modifications of the AGM model
seem to be necessary in applications to preferences (Hansson 1995,
Lang and van der Torre 2008, Grüne-Yanoff and Hansson 2009).
The preceding sections have only dealt with changes of one and the
same belief set or belief base. This is clearly a severe limitation. A
realistic model of belief change should allow for repeated (iterated)
changes, such as \(K\div p\div q* r* s\div t\ldots\) In other words,
operations are needed that can contract or revise any belief set
(belief base) by any sentence. Such operations are called
global, in contrast to local operations that are
defined only for a single specified set.
An obvious way to obtain a global operation of partial meet
contraction would be to use the same selection function for all
sets to be contracted. However, with the standard way to obtain a
partial meet contraction from a selection function, this is not
possible, due to the way selection functions treat the empty set. The
way selection functions have traditionally been defined, if \(A\bot p
= \varnothing\), then \(\gamma(A\bot p ) = \{A\}\). As a consequence
of this, if \(\gamma\) is a selection function for \(A\), and \(A \ne
B\), then \(\gamma\) is not a selection function for \(B\). For let
\(A\bot p = B\bot p = \varnothing\). For \(\gamma\) to be a function
it must be the case that \(\gamma(A\bot p) = \gamma(B\bot p)\). For
\(\gamma\) to be a selection function for \(A\) it must be case that
\(\gamma(A\bot p) = \{A\}\), and in order for it to be a selection
function for \(B\) it must be the case that \(\gamma(B\bot p) =
\{B\}\). Since \(A \ne B\), this is impossible.
This can be solved if we rewrite the definition of partial meet
contraction as follows:
Alternative definition of partial meet contraction:
\((1')\) \(\gamma(K\bot p) \subseteq K\bot p\), and if \(K\bot p \ne
\varnothing\), then \(\gamma(K\bot p) \ne \varnothing\).
\((2')\) \(K\div p = \bigcap \gamma(K\bot p)\), unless \(\gamma(K\bot
p) = \varnothing\), in which case \(K\div p = K\).
As applied to a single belief set \(K\), this definition is equivalent
with the original definition. Notably, it yields the same result as
the original definition even in the limiting case when \(p\) is a
tautology, but it avoids using the selection function in this limiting
case. With this, slightly adjusted, definition, one and the same
selection function can be used for all belief sets, and consequently
we can construct iterated change using only one, AGM-style, selection
function. Since partial meet revision is definable from partial meet
contraction via the Levi identity, this means that we have global
operations for both contraction and revision. This construction is so
general that it does not impose any new properties on contraction or
revision, i.e. no properties in addition to the usual AGM postulates
(Hansson 2012). 
However, most of the discussion on iterated change has been based on
the assumption that such additional properties are plausible and
indeed desirable. The so-called Darwiche-Pearl postulates for revision
have had a central role in these discussions (Darwiche and Pearl
1997):
If \(q \vdash p\), then \((K * p) * q = K * q\). (DP1)
If \(q \vdash \neg p\), then \((K * p) * q = K * q\). (DP2)
If \(K * q \vdash p\), then \((K * p) * q \vdash p\). (DP3)
If \(K * q\) ⊬ \(\neg p\), then \((K * p) * q\) ⊬ \(\neg
p\) (DP4) 
The Darwiche-Pearl postulates express an intuition about the epistemic
ordering of possible worlds, namely that when we revise by a sentence
\(p\), then the ordering among \(p\)-worlds should be unchanged, and
so should the ordering among \(\neg p\)-worlds. The change takes the
form of a shift of the relative positions of these two parts of the
original ordering of worlds. A large number of proposals for such
shifts have been put forward, but opinions differ widely on the
adequacy of these proposals.
Abhaya Nayak (1994) has proposed a model of iterated belief change in
which both the belief states and the inputs are binary relations that
satisfy the standard entrenchment postulates except Minimality. Inputs
of this type may be seen as “fragments” of belief states,
to be incorporated into the previous belief state. In the same vein,
Eduardo Fermé and Hans Rott (2004) have investigated belief
revision with inputs of the more general form: “accept \(q\)
with a degree of plausibility that at least equals that of
\(p\)”. They call this revision by comparison. Belief
states are represented by entrenchment orderings. Hence, from an
entrenchment ordering \(\le\) and such a generalized input a new
entrenchment ordering \(\le '\) is obtained that contains the
information needed to construct the new belief set. 
In spite of the dominant position of the AGM model and its close
variants, several other formal models of belief changes have been
proposed.
In belief revision theory, the focus is on consistency rather than
truthfulness. In contrast, learning theory is devoted to induction and
the attainment of true beliefs. A research question is represented as
a partition of the set of possible worlds, i.e. a distribution of all
possible worlds into non-overlapping sets. The research question has
been fully answered when it is known which of these partitions
contains the actual world. Information received by the agent
successively narrows down the set of partitions that may contain it.
The central issue is how to construct an inductive strategy, i.e. a
strategy for which investigations to perform and in what order, and
how to interpret them (Kelly 1999). Although this problem has
connections with belief revision, operations not satisfying the
standard AGM postulates have usually played a prominent role in the
discussion. (Genin and Kelly 2019)
Dynamic doxastic logic (DDL) was introduced by Krister Segerberg to
represent an agent who has opinions about the external world and
changes these opinions upon receipt of new information. DDL makes use
of epistemic modal operators of the type introduced by Hintikka
(1962). The sentence \(B_i p\) denotes that the individual \(i\)
believes that \(p\). When only one agent is under consideration, the
subscript can be deleted, and the operator \(B\) can be read “it
is believed that” or “the agent believes that”
(Segerberg 1995, p. 536). 
The formula \(Bp\) in DDL differs from the expression \(p \in K\) of
AGM in being a sentence in the same language as \(p\). This makes it
possible to express in the object language that a sentence is
believed. In this way, Segerberg attempted to develop belief revision
“as a generalization of ordinary Hintikka type doxastic
logic”, whereas in contrast “AGM is not really logic; it
is a theory about theories” (Segerberg 1999, p. 136). In the DDL
framework it is possible to express beliefs about beliefs. The
sentence “\(i\) believes that \(i\) does not believe that
\(p\)” can be expressed as \(B_i \neg B_i p\), whereas there is
no way to express it in the AGM framework. \(((p \not\in K_i) \in
K_i\) is not a well-formed formula.)
In DDL, belief revision operations (expansion, revision, and
contraction) are expressed with dynamic modal operators, similar to
those used for program execution. (This element of DDL was present
also in previous publications by several authors. See Fuhrmann 1991;
de Rijke 1994; van Benthem 1989 and 1995.) Segerberg used the
following notation:
The combination of these two elements, belief operators and dynamic
operators, results in a framework that differs from AGM in important
ways. (Leitgeb and Segerberg 2007, 169)
Largely similar systems have been developed under the name of Dynamic
Epistemic Logic, DEL (Plaza 1989; Baltag et al. 1998; van Ditmarsch et
al. 2007; see the entry on
 dynamic-epistemic logic).
 A major difference between DDL and DEL is that the latter has mostly
been studied in multiagent contexts. The most studied dynamics is that
of the public announcement of some sentence (van Ditmarsch et al.
2007). 
Descriptor revision (Hansson 2017) is based on two major formal
constructions. One of them is a metalinguistic belief predicate
\(\mathfrak{B}\) that is applied to sentences of the object language.
\(\mathfrak{B}p\) denotes that the sentence \(p\) is believed, \(\neg
\mathfrak{B}p\) that it is not believed, and \(\mathfrak{B}p\vee
\mathfrak{B}q\) that either \(p\) or \(q\) is believed. Such sentences
can be used to express the success conditions of belief change
operations. Thus \(\mathfrak{B}p\) is the success condition of
revision by \(p\), \(\neg \mathfrak{B}p\) that of contraction by \(p\)
and \(\{\neg \mathfrak{B}p,\neg \mathfrak{B}q\}\) that of multiple
contraction by \(\{p,q\}\). Due to the versatility of descriptors we
only need one operation, denoted \(\circ\). Hence, \(K\circ
\mathfrak{B}p\) represents revision by \(p\) and \(K \circ \neg
\mathfrak{B}p\) contraction by \(p\). 
The other major formal construction is a choice function (selection
function) that operates directly on the set of potential outcomes of
an operation. Hence, the operation \(K \circ \mathfrak{B}p\) is
performed by choosing one among the potential belief sets that contain
\(p\) (presumably that which is most choiceworthy, or closest at
hand). Operations based on these principles have been axiomatically
characterized. Notably, the recovery postulate that creates problems
in the AGM framework does not hold in the descriptor revision
framework. The application of a choice function to potential belief
outcomes is arguably more plausible than its application to possible
worlds or remainders, since the latter two entities are logically
infinite (if the language is so), and therefore cognitively
inaccessible.
Descriptor revision makes it possible to investigate operations of
change more generally, and to discuss properties that can hold for
operations with different types of the success conditions. Let \(
\Psi\) and \( \Xi\) be descriptors, i.e. sets of sentences containing
the \( \mathfrak{B}\) operator. Let \(K ⊩\Psi\) denote that
\(K\) satisfies all the conditions in \(\Psi\). Some examples of such
general properties of descriptor revision are:
Closure:

\(K \circ \Psi = \Cn(K \circ \Psi)\)
Relative success:

\(K \circ \Psi ⊩ \Psi\) or \( K \circ \Psi=K\)
Regularity:

If \(K \circ \Xi ⊩ \Psi\), then \(K \circ \Psi ⊩
\Psi\)
Confirmation:

If \(K ⊩\Psi\), then \(K \circ \Psi=K)\)
Cumulativity:

If \(K \circ \Psi ⊩\Xi\), then \(K \circ \Psi = K \circ
(\Psi\cup\Xi) \)
The AGM model and other logical frameworks for belief revision are
based on a dichotomous approach to belief: either something is
believed or it is not, in either case without any gradations. Beliefs
can be be more or less easily given up, and non-beliefs can be more or
less easily turned into beliefs, but the very act of believing does
not admit of degrees. In contrast, probabilistic models of belief,
usually based on some form of subjective Bayesianism, admit all
degrees between the strongest belief and the strongest disbelief.
Dichotomous and probabilistic models represent different features of
belief systems. It has proved to be difficult to construct a
reasonably manageable model that covers both the logic-related and the
probabilistic properties of belief change. These difficulties are
closely connected with the lottery and preface paradoxes (Kyburg 1961;
Makinson 1965).
However, belief revision theory has turned out to be useful in dealing
with the problematic limiting case of conditional probabilities with a
condition that has probability zero. Insights from belief revision
theory have been used in the construction of non-standard models of
probabilities in which conditionalization can be performed also in
this limiting case (Makinson 2011).
