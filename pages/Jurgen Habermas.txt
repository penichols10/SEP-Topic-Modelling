Born outside Düsseldorf in 1929, Habermas came of age in
postwar Germany. The Nuremberg Trials were a key formative moment that
brought home to him the depth of Germany's moral and political
failure under National Socialism. This experience was later reinforced
when, as a graduate student interested in Heidegger's
existentialism, he read the latter's reissued Introduction to
Metaphysics, in which Heidegger had retained (or more accurately,
reintroduced) an allusion to the “inner truth and
greatness” of National Socialism (Heidegger 1959, 199). When
Habermas (1953) publicly called for an explanation from Heidegger, the
latter's silence confirmed Habermas's conviction that the
German philosophical tradition had failed in its moment of reckoning,
providing intellectuals with the resources neither to understand nor to
criticize National Socialism. This negative experience of the relation
between philosophy and politics subsequently motivated his search for
conceptual resources from Anglo-American thought, particularly its
pragmatic and democratic traditions. In moving outside the German
tradition, Habermas joined a number of young postwar intellectuals such
as Karl-Otto Apel (for Habermas's autobiographical sketch, see
2005b, chap. 1; also Wiggershaus 2004).
Habermas completed his dissertation in 1954 at the University of
Bonn, writing on the conflict between the absolute and history in
Schelling's thought. He first gained serious public attention, at
least in Germany, with the 1962 publication of his habilitation,
Strukturwandel der Öffentlichkeit (Structural
Transformation of the Public Sphere; English ed., 1989), a detailed
social history of the development of the bourgeois public sphere from
its origins in the 18th century salons up to its
transformation through the influence of capital-driven mass media. In
his description of the salons we clearly see his interest in a
communicative ideal that later would provide the core normative
standard for his moral-political theory: the idea of inclusive critical
discussion, free of social and economic pressures, in which
interlocutors treat each other as equals in a cooperative attempt to
reach an understanding on matters of common concern. As an ideal at the
center of bourgeois culture, this kind of interchange was probably
never fully realized; nonetheless, it “was not mere
ideology” (1989, 160, also 36). As these small discussion
societies grew into mass publics in the 19th century,
however, ideas became commodities, assimilated to the economics of mass
media consumption. Rather than give up on the idea of public reason,
Habermas called for a socioinstitutionally feasible concept of public
opinion-formation “that is historically meaningful, that
normatively meets the requirements of the social-welfare state, and
that is theoretically clear and empirically identifiable.” Such a
concept “can be grounded only in the structural transformation of
the public sphere itself and in the dimension of its development”
(ibid., 244). His concluding sketch of such a concept (ibid., 244–48)
already contains in outline the two-level model of democratic
deliberation he later elaborates in his mature work on law and
democracy, Between Facts and Norms (1996b; German ed.,
1992b).
Habermas's interest in the political subsequently led him to a
series of philosophical studies and critical-social analyses that
eventually appeared in English in his Toward a Rational
Society (1970) and Theory and Practice (1973b). Whereas
the latter consists primarily of reflections on the history of
philosophy, the former represents an attempt to apply his emerging
theory of rationality to the critical analysis of contemporary society,
in particular the student protest movement and its institutional
target, the authoritarian and technocratic structures that held sway in
higher education and politics.
Habermas's critical reflection takes a nuanced approach to both sides
of the social unrest that characterized the late sixties.  Although
sympathetic with students' demand for more democratic participation
and hopeful that their activism harbored a potential for positive
social transformation, he also did not hesitate to criticize its
militant aspects, which he labeled self-delusory and
“pernicious” (1970, 48). In his critique of
technocracy—governance by scientific experts and
bureaucracy—he relied on a philosophical framework that
anticipates categories in his later thought, minus the philosophy of
language he would work out in the 1970s. Specifically, Habermas
sharply distinguished between two modes of action, “work”
and “interaction,” which correspond to enduring interests
of the human species (ibid., chap. 6). The former includes modes of
action based on the rational choice of efficient means, that is, forms
of instrumental and strategic action, whereas the latter refers to
forms of “communicative action” in which actors coordinate
their behaviors on the basis of “consensual norms” (ibid.,
91–92). Habermas's distinction in effect appropriates the
classical Aristotelian contrast between techne and
praxis for critical social theory (1973b, chap. 1). The result
is a distinctively Habermasian critique of science and technology as
ideology: by reducing practical questions about the good life to
technical problems for experts, contemporary elites eliminate the need
for public, democratic discussion of values, thereby depoliticizing the
population (1970, chap. 6). The legitimate human interest in technical
control of nature thus functions as an ideology—a screen that
masks the value-laden character of government decisionmaking in the
service of the capitalist status quo. Unlike Herbert Marcuse, who
regarded that interest as specific to capitalist society, Habermas
affirmed the technical control of nature as a genuinely universal
species-interest; pace Horkheimer and Adorno in their Dialectic
of Enlightenment, the technical interest did not necessitate
social domination.
Habermas defended this philosophical anthropology most fully in his
Knowledge and Human Interests (1971b; German ed., 1968b), the
work that represents his first attempt to provide a systematic
framework for an interdisciplinary critical social theory. As Habermas
conceived his task, he had to establish critical social theory as a
respectable, distinct form of knowledge, in large measure through a
methodological critique of the then-dominant positivist philosophy of
science and historicist hermeneutics. He thus develops a theory of
“knowledge-constitutive interests” that are tied both to
“the natural history of the human species” and to
“the imperatives of the socio-cultural form of life,” but
are not reducible to them (ibid., 168).
There are three knowledge-constitutive interests, each rooted in human
existence and expressed in a particular type of scientific or
scholarly inquiry. The first is the “technical interest,”
the “anthropologically deep-seated interest” we have in
the prediction and control of the natural environment. This interest
structures modes of inquiry and knowledge-production in the
“empirical-analytic” sciences, that is, the natural
sciences and types of social science that aim at testable general
explanations (in contrast to the interpretive social sciences, which
aim at cultural understanding, and the
“normative-analytic” sciences, such as rational choice
theory, which rely on formal modeling and deduction based on
counterfactual axioms; see 1988a, 43ff). As a deep-seated structure
constitutive of knowledge, the technical “interest” refers
not to the motivations of scientists or specific disciplinary aims,
but rather to a way of approaching nature and society as objects of
possible knowledge: in tying knowledge-production to controlled
observation and methodical experimentation, the empirical-analytic
sciences deploy basic species-capacities to master the natural world
via feedback-monitored instrumental action. To be sure, Habermas's
analysis relies heavily on a hypothetico-deductive model that was in
serious trouble even as he wrote. But his core idea is arguably
broader in scope: the empirical-analytic sciences are distinguished by
their treatment of the object domain as governed by predictable
law-like regularities that allow for certain types of methodologically
controlled techniques of inquiry that would be inappropriate for the
interpretive sciences. Thus the technical interest applies not only to
sciences that promise technological benefits, but also to sciences
like paleontology.
The interpretive, or cultural-hermeneutic sciences, rest on a second,
equally deep-seated “practical interest” in securing and
expanding possibilities of mutual and self-understanding in the
conduct of life. These sciences presuppose and articulate modes of
action-orienting (inter)personal understanding that operate within
socio-cultural forms of life and the grammar of ordinary
language. Human societies depend on such understanding, and the
interpretive competences that go with it, just as much as they depend
on mastering the natural environment. The hermeneutic sciences, then,
bring methodical discipline to features of everyday interaction, and
in that sense are on a par with the empirical-analytic sciences, which
elevate everyday instrumental action to experimental method. By making
these first two cognitive interests explicit, Habermas seeks to go
beyond positivist accounts of the natural and social sciences. On his
view, those accounts tend to ignore the role that deep-seated human
interests play in the constitution of possible objects of inquiry.
In making cognitive interests explicit, Habermas also engages in a
kind of critical self-reflection, more precisely a methodological
reflection that aims to free science from its positivist
illusions. Such reflection exemplifies the third cognitive interest,
the emancipatory interest of reason in overcoming dogmatism,
compulsion, and domination. For scientific expressions of this
interest, he looked to Freudian psychology and a version of Marxist
social theory. The status of the emancipatory interest, however, was
problematic from the start, for it conflated two kinds of critical
reflection. Whereas his critique of positivism and theory of cognitive
interests involve reflective articulation of the formal structures of
knowledge, Freudian and Marxist critique aim to unmask concrete cases
of personal self-deception and social-political ideology (1973cd). Nor
was it clear that psychoanalysis provided an apt model of liberatory
reflection in any case, as critics pointed out how the asymmetries
between patient and analyst could not represent the proper
intersubjective form for emancipation. These and other deficits of his
analysis posed a challenge for Habermas that would guide a decade-long
search for the normative and empirical basis of critique. Whatever the
best path to the epistemic and normative basis for critique might be,
it would have to pass a democratic test: that “in Enlightenment
there are only participants” (1973b, 44). Habermas will not
resolve this methodological issue until a series of transitional
studies in the 1970s culminates in his mature systematic work, The
Theory of Communicative Action (1984a/1987; German ed., 1981;
hereafter cited as TCA).
That said, we can discern enduring features in Habermas's
early attempt at a comprehensive model of social criticism. As a theory
of rationality and knowledge, his theory of knowledge-constitutive
interests is both pragmatic and pluralistic: pragmatic, inasmuch as
human interests constitute knowledge; pluralistic, in that different
forms of inquiry and knowledge emerge from different core interests. In
Knowledge and Human Interests we can thus see the beginnings
of a methodologically pluralistic approach to critical social theory,
more on which below. Besides the problems described above, however, the
analysis was hampered by a framework that still relied on motifs from a
“philosophy of consciousness” fixated on the constitution
of objects of possible experience—an approach that cannot do
justice to the discursive dimensions of inquiry (1973cd; 2000; also
Müller-Doohm 2000). In the 1970s Habermas set about a fundamental
overhaul of his framework for critical theory (see McCarthy 1978).
In the period between Knowledge and Human Interests and
The Theory of Communicative Action, Habermas began to develop
a distinctive method for elaborating the relationship between a
theoretical social science of modern societies, on the one hand, and
the normative and philosophical basis for critique, on the other.
Following Horkheimer's definition of Critical Theory, Habermas
pursued three aims in his attempt to combine social science and
philosophical analysis: it must be at once explanatory, practical, and
normative. This meant that philosophy could not,
as it did for Kant, become the sole basis for normative reflection.
Rather, Habermas argued, adequate critique requires a thoroughgoing
cooperation between philosophy and social science. This sort of
analysis is characteristic of Legitimation Crisis (1975;
German ed., 1973e), in which Habermas analyzes the modern state as
subject to endemic crises, which arise from the fact that the state
cannot simultaneously meet the demands for rational problem solving,
democracy, and cultural identity. Here the social science to which
Habermas appeals is more sociological and functional. Similarly, in
this work and in Communication and the Evolution of Society
(1979), Habermas begins to develop a distinctive conception of rational
reconstruction, which models societal development as a learning
process. In these works, Habermas begins to incorporate the results of
developmental psychology, which aligns stages of development with
changes in the kinds of reasons that the maturing individual considers
acceptable. Analogously, societies develop through similar changes in
the rational basis of legitimacy on the collective level. At this point
in his theorizing, Habermas's appropriation of the social
sciences has become methodologically and theoretically pluralistic: on
his view, a critical social theory is not distinctive in light of
endorsing some particular theory or method but as uniting normative and
empirical inquiry.
In this transitional phase from Knowledge and Human Interests
to The Theory of Communicative Action, Habermas's basic
philosophical endeavor was to develop a more modest, fallibilist,
empirical account of the philosophical claim to universality and
rationality. This more modest approach moves Critical Theory away from
its strong transcendental framework, exemplified in the theory of
cognitive interests with the unmistakably Kantian language of
object-constitution. In setting that earlier project aside, Habermas
adopts a more naturalistic, “postmetaphysical” approach
(1992a), characterized by the fallible hermeneutic explication or
"reconstruction" of shared competences and normative presuppositions
that allow actors to engage in familiar practices of communication,
discourse, and inquiry. In articulating presuppositions of practice,
reconstructive analysis remains weakly transcendental. But it also
qualifies as a “weak naturalism” inasmuch as the practices
it aims to articulate are consistent with the natural evolution of the
species and located in the empirical world (2003a, 10-30, 83ff);
consequently, postmetaphysical reconstruction links up with specific
forms of social-scientific knowledge in analyzing general conditions
of rationality manifested in various human capacities and powers.
Habermas's encounter with speech act theory proved to be
particularly decisive for this project. In speech act theory, he finds
the basis for a conception of communicative competence (on the model of
Chomsky's linguistic competence). Given this emphasis on
language, Habermas is often said to have taken a kind of
“linguistic turn” in this period. He framed his first
essays on formal pragmatics (1976ab) as an alternative to Niklas
Luhmann's systems theory. Habermas understands formal pragmatics
as one of the “reconstructive sciences,” which aim to
render theoretically explicit the intuitive, pretheoretical know-how
underlying such basic human competences as speaking and understanding,
judging and acting. Unlike Kant's transcendental analysis of the
conditions of rationality, reconstructive sciences yield knowledge that
is not necessary but hypothetical, not a priori but empirical, not
certain but fallible. They are nevertheless directed to invariant
structures and conditions and raise universal, but defeasible claims to
an account of practical reason.
With the turn to language and reconstructive science, Habermas
undermines both of the traditional Kantian roles for philosophy:
philosophy as the sole judge in normative matters and as the
methodological authority that assigns the various domains of inquiry to
their proper questions. In Habermas's view, philosophy must
engage in a fully cooperative relationship with the social sciences and
the empirical disciplines in general. This step is completed in The
Theory of Communicative Action, to which we now turn.
To understand Habermas's mature positions, we must start with
his Theory of Communicative Action (TCA), a
two-volume critical study of the theories of rationality that informed
the classical sociologies of Weber, Durkheim, Parsons, and neo-Marxist
critical theory (esp. Lukács, Horkheimer,
Adorno). In TCA we find Habermas's conception of the task of
philosophy and its relation to the social sciences—a conception
that still guides much of his work. While TCA defends the
emphasis on normativity and the universalist ambitions found in the
philosophical tradition, it does so within a framework that includes
particular sorts of empirical social research, with which philosophy
must interact. Philosophers, that is, must cooperate with social
scientists if they are to understand normative claims within the
current historical context, the context of a complex, modern society
that is characterized by social and systemic modes of integration. By
recognizing both modes of integration, one avoids the pessimism
associated with theories of modernity whose one-sided, primarily
instrumental conception of rationality misses the cultural dimension
of modernization.
Starting with Marx's historical materialism, large-scale
macrosociological and historical theories have long been held to be the
most appropriate explanatory basis for critical social science.
However, such theories have two drawbacks for the critical project.
First, comprehensiveness does not ensure explanatory power. Indeed,
there are many such large-scale theories, each with their own
distinctive and exemplary social phenomena that guide their attempt at
unification. Second, a close examination of standard critical
explanations, such as the theory of ideology, shows that such
explanations typically appeal to a variety of different social theories
(Bohman 1999). Habermas's actual employment of critical
explanations bears this out. His criticism of modern societies turns on
the explanation of the relationship between two very different
theoretical terms: a micro-theory of rationality based on communicative
coordination and a macro-theory of the systemic integration of modern
societies through such mechanisms as the market (TCA, vol. 2).
In concrete terms, this means that Habermas develops a two-level social
theory that includes an analysis of communicative rationality, the
rational potential built into everyday speech, on the one hand; and a
theory of modern society and modernization, on the other (White 1989).
On the basis of this theory, Habermas hopes to be able to assess the
gains and losses of modernization and to overcome its one-sided version
of rationalization.
Comprehensive critical theories make two problematic assumptions:
that there is one preferred mode of critical explanation, and that
there is one preferred goal of social criticism, namely a socialist
society that fulfills the norm of human emancipation. Only with such a
goal in the background does the two-step process of employing
historical materialism to establish an epistemically and normatively
independent stance make sense. The correctness or incorrectness of such
a critical model depends not on its acceptance or rejection by its
addressees, but on the adequacy of the theory to objective historical
necessities or mechanisms (into which the critical theorist alleges to
have superior insight). A pluralistic mode of critical inquiry suggests
a different norm of correctness: that criticism must be verified by
those participating in the practice and that this demand for practical
verification is part of the process of inquiry itself.
Although Habermas's attitude toward these different modes of critical
theory is somewhat ambivalent, he has given good reasons to accept the
practical, pluralist approach. Just as in the analysis of modes of
inquiry tied to distinct knowledge-constitutive interests, Habermas
accepts that various theories and methods each have “a relative
legitimacy.” Indeed, like Dewey he goes so far as to argue that
the logic of social explanation is pluralistic and eludes the
“apparatus of general theories.” In the absence of any
such general theories, the most fruitful approach to social-scientific
knowledge is to bring all the various methods and theories into
relation to each other: “Whereas the natural and the cultural or
hermeneutic sciences are capable of living in mutually indifferent,
albeit more hostile than peaceful coexistence, the social sciences
must bear the tension of divergent approaches under one roof”
(1988a, 3). In TCA, Habermas casts critical social theory in
a similarly pluralistic, yet unifying way. In discussing various
accounts of societal modernization, for example, he argues that the
main existing theories have their own “particular
legitimacy” as developed lines of empirical research, and that
Critical Theory takes on the task of critically unifying the various
theories and their heterogeneous methods and
presuppositions. “Critical social theory does not relate to
established lines of research as a competitor; starting from its
concept of the rise of modern societies, it attempts to explain the
specific limitations and the relative rights of those
approaches” (TCA, 2: 375).
To achieve these theoretical and methodological ends, Habermas
begins this task with a discussion of theories of rationality and
offers his own distinctive definition of rationality, one that is
epistemic, practical, and intersubjective. For Habermas, rationality
consists not so much in the possession of particular knowledge, but
rather in “how speaking and acting subjects acquire and use
knowledge” (TCA, 1: 11). Any such account is
“pragmatic” because it shares a number of distinctive
features with other views that see interpreters as competent and
knowledgeable agents. Most importantly, a pragmatic approach develops
an account of practical knowledge in the “performative
attitude,” that is, from the point of view of a competent
speaker. A theory of rationality thus attempts to reconstruct the
practical knowledge necessary for being a knowledgeable social actor
among other knowledgeable social actors. As already mentioned, Habermas's
reconstruction attempts to articulate invariant structures of
communication, and so qualifies as a “formal pragmatics.”
What is the “performative attitude” that is to be
reconstructed in such a theory? From a social-scientific point of view,
language is a medium for coordinating action, although not the only
such medium. The fundamental form of coordination through language,
according to Habermas, requires speakers to adopt a practical stance
oriented toward “reaching understanding,” which he regards
as the “inherent telos” of speech. When actors address one
another with this sort of practical attitude, they engage in what
Habermas calls “communicative action,” which he
distinguishes from strategic forms of social action. Because this
distinction plays a fundamental role in TCA, it deserves some
attention.
In strategic action, actors are not so much interested in mutual
understanding as in achieving the individual goals they each bring to
the situation. Actor A, for example, will thus appeal to
B's desires and fears so as to motivate the behavior on
B's part that is required for A's success. As
reasons motivating B's cooperation, B's desires and
fears are only contingently related to A's goals. B
cooperates with A, in other words, not because B
finds A's project inherently interesting or worthy, but
because of what B gets out of the bargain: avoiding some
threat that A can make or obtaining something A has
promised (which may be of inherent interest to B but for
A is only a means of motivating B).
In communicative action, or what Habermas later came to call
“strong communicative action” in “Some Further
Clarifications of the Concept of Communicative Rationality”
(1998b, chap. 7; German ed., 1999b), speakers coordinate their action
and pursuit of individual (or joint) goals on the basis of a shared
understanding that the goals are inherently reasonable or merit-worthy.
Whereas strategic action succeeds insofar as the actors achieve their
individual goals, communicative action succeeds insofar as the actors
freely agree that their goal (or goals) is reasonable, that it merits
cooperative behavior. Communicative action is thus an inherently
consensual form of social coordination in which actors “mobilize
the potential for rationality” given with ordinary language and
its telos of rationally motivated agreement. 
To support his conception of communication action, Habermas must
specify the mechanism that makes rationally motivated agreement
possible. Toward that end, he argues for a particular account of
utterance meaning as based on “acceptability conditions,”
by analogy to the truth-conditional account of the meaning of
sentences. But rather than linking meaning with representational
semantics, Habermas takes a pragmatic approach, analyzing the
conditions for the illocutionary success of the speech act. According
to the core principle of his pragmatic theory of meaning, “we
understand a speech act when we know the kinds of reasons that a
speaker could provide in order to convince a hearer that he is entitled
in the given circumstances to claim validity for his utterance—in
short, when we know what makes it acceptable” (1998b,
232). With this principle, Habermas ties the meaning of speech acts to
the practice of reason giving: speech acts inherently involve claims
that are in need of reasons—claims that are open to both
criticism and justification. In our everyday speech (and in much of our
action), speakers tacitly commit themselves to explaining and
justifying themselves, if necessary. To understand what one is doing in
making a speech act, therefore, one must have some sense of the
appropriate response that would justify one's speech act, were
one challenged to do so. A speech act succeeds in reaching
understanding when the hearer takes up “an affirmative
position” toward the claim made by the speaker (TCA 1:
95–97; 282; 297). In doing so, the hearer presumes that the claims in
the speech act could be supported by good reasons (even if she has not
asked for them). When the offer made by the speaker fails to receive
uptake, speaker and hearer may shift reflexive levels, from ordinary
speech to “discourse”—processes of argumentation and
dialogue in which the claims implicit in the speech act are tested for
their rational justifiability as true, correct or authentic. Thus the
rationality of communicative action is tied to the rationality of
discourse, more on which in section 3.2.
What are these claims that are open to criticism and justification?
In opposition to the positivist fixation on fact-stating modes of
discourse, Habermas does not limit intersubjectively valid, or
justifiable, claims to the category of empirical truth, but instead
recognizes a spectrum of “validity claims” that also
includes, at the least, claims to moral rightness, ethical goodness or
authenticity, personal sincerity, and aesthetic value (TCA 1:
8–23; 1993, chap. 1). Although Habermas does not consider such claims
to represent a mind-independent world in the manner of empirical truth
claims, they can be both publicly criticized as unjustifiable and
defended by publicly convincing arguments. To this extent, validity
involves a notion of correctness analogous to the idea of truth. In
this context, the phrase “validity claim,” as a translation
of the German term Geltungsanspruch, does not have the narrow
logical sense (truth-preserving argument forms), but rather connotes a
richer social idea—that a claim (statement) merits the
addressee's acceptance because it is justified or true in some
sense, which can vary according to the sphere of validity and
dialogical context.
By linking meaning with the acceptability of speech acts, Habermas
moves the analysis beyond a narrow focus on the truth-conditional
semantics of representation to the social intelligibility of
interaction. The complexity of social interaction then allows him to
find three basic validity claims potentially at stake in any speech act
used for cooperative purposes (i.e., in strong communicative action).
His argument relies on three “world relations” that are
potentially involved in strongly communicative acts in which a speaker
intends to say something to someone about something (TCA 1:
275ff). For example, a constative (fact-stating) speech act (a)
expresses an inner world (an intention to communicate a belief); (b)
establishes a communicative relation with a hearer (and thus relates to
a social world, specifically one in which both persons share a piece of
information, and know they do); and (c) attempts to represent the
external world. This triadic structure suggests that many speech acts,
including non-constatives, involve a set of tacit validity claims: the
claim that the speech act is sincere (non-deceptive), is socially
appropriate or right, and is factually true (or more broadly:
representationally adequate). Conversely, speech acts can be criticized
for failing on one or more of these scores. Thus fully successful
speech acts, insofar as they involve these three world relations, must
satisfy the demands connected with these three basic validity claims
(sincerity, rightness, and truth) in order to be acceptable.
We can think of strong communicative action in the above sense as
defining the end of a spectrum of communicative possibilities. At that
end, social cooperation is both deeply consensual and reasonable:
actors sincerely agree that their modes of cooperation can be justified
as good, right, and free of empirical error. Given the difficulties of
maintaining such deep consensus, however, it makes sense, particularly
in complex, pluralistic societies, to relax these communicative demands
for specified types of situations, allowing for weaker forms of
communicative action (in which not all three types of validity claims
are at stake) or strategic action (in which actors understand that
everyone is oriented toward individual success). 
Habermas distinguishes the “system” as those predefined
situations, or modes of coordination, in which the demands of
communicative action are relaxed in this way, within legally specified
limits. The prime examples of systemic coordination are markets and
bureaucracies. In these systemically structured contexts, nonlinguistic
media take up the slack in coordinating actions, which proceeds on the
basis of money and institutional power—these media do the
talking, as it were, thus relieving actors of the demands of strongly
communicative action. The term “lifeworld,” by contrast,
refers to domains of action in which consensual modes of action
coordination predominate. In fact, the distinction between lifeworld
and system is better understood as an analytic one that identifies
different aspects of social interaction and cooperation (1991b).
“Lifeworld” then refers to the background resources,
contexts, and dimensions of social action that enable actors to
cooperate on the basis of mutual understanding: shared cultural systems
of meaning, institutional orders that stabilize patterns of action, and
personality structures acquired in family, church, neighborhood, and
school (TCA 1: chap. 6; 1998b, chap. 4). 
Habermas's system-lifeworld distinction has been criticized from a
number of perspectives. Some have argued that the distinction
oversimplifies the interpenetrating dynamics of social institutions
(e.g., McCarthy 1991, 152–80). Others attacked the distinction
as covertly ideological, concealing forms of patriarchal and economic
domination (e.g., Fraser 1985). Habermas's attempt to clarify the
analytic character of the distinction only goes partway toward
answering these criticisms (1991b).
TCA has also encountered rather heavy weather as a theory of
meaning. In the analytic philosophy of language, one of the standard
requirements is to account for the compositionality of language, the
fact that a finite set of words can be used to form an indefinite
number of sentences. From that perspective, Habermas's theory falls
short (Heath 2001, chap. 3). But perhaps we would do better to assess
Habermas's theory of meaning from a different perspective.  The
compositionality requirement is important if one wants to explain
grammatical competence. But early on Habermas (1976b) expressed a
greater interest in explaining communicative, rather than grammatical,
competence: the ability of speakers to use grammatically
well-formed sentences in social contexts. Although Habermas often
presents his pragmatics as a further development in analytic theories
of meaning, his analysis focuses primarily on the context-sensitive
acceptability of speech acts: acceptability conditions as a
function of formal features that distinguish different speech
situations. This suggests his theory of meaning involves a quite
different sort of project: to articulate the “validity
basis” of social order.
The significance of this conception of reaching understanding and of
rationally motivated agreement can also be seen by contrasting this
account with other conceptions of understanding and interpretation, such
as Gadamer's hermeneutics. Given Habermas's conception of
speech acts and their relation to validity claims, it is not surprising
that he argues that “communicative actions always require
interpretations that are rational in approach” (TCA 1:
106), that is, ones that are made in the performative attitude by an
interpreter. In general, Habermas agrees with hermeneutics that the
whole domain of the social sciences is accessible only through
interpretation, precisely because processes of reaching understanding
already at work in the social sciences have antecedently constituted
them (ibid., 107). But he draws a distinctive conclusion. Although
social scientists are not actors, they must employ their own
pretheoretical knowledge to gain interpretive access through
communicative experience. As a “virtual participant,” the
social scientist must take a position on the claims made by those he
observes: he has access through communicative experience only
“under the presupposition that he judges the agreement and
disagreement, the validity claims and potential reasons with which he
is confronted” (ibid., 116). There is then no disjunction between
the attitude of the critic and the interpreter as reflective
participants. Social scientists may withhold judgments, but only at the
cost of impoverishing their interpretation and putting out of play
their pretheoretical, practical knowledge that they have in common with
others who are able to reach understanding. Thus, various forms of
rationality become essential to the social sciences, because of the
nature of the social domain. 
Objecting to Habermas's line of argument, McCarthy and others
have argued that it is not a necessary condition that interpreters take
a position in order to understand reasons, even if we have to rely on
our own competence to judge the validity and soundness of reasons and
to identify them as reasons at all. Nonetheless, Habermas uses this
conception in his social theory of modernity to show the ways in which
modern culture has unleashed communicative rationality from its
previous cultural and ideological constraints. In modern societies,
social norms are no longer presumed to be valid but rather are
subjected to critical reflection, as for example when the ethical life
of a specific culture is criticized from the standpoint of justice. In
a sense consistent with the Enlightenment imperative to use one's
own reason, the everyday “lifeworld” of social experience
has been rationalized, especially in the form of discourses that
institutionalize reflective communicative action, as in scientific and
democratic institutions. 
The rationalization of the lifeworld in Western modernity went
hand-in-hand with the growth of systemic mechanisms of coordination
already mentioned above, in which the demands on fully communicative
consensus are relaxed. If large and complex modern societies can no
longer be integrated solely on the basis of shared cultural values and
norms, new nonintentional mechanisms of coordination must emerge, which
take the form of nonlinguistic media of money and power. For example,
markets coordinate the collective production and distribution of goods
nonintentionally, even if they are grounded in cultural and political
institutions such as firms and states. Modernization can become
pathological, as when money and power “colonize the
lifeworld” and displace communicative forms of solidarity and
inhibit the reproduction of the lifeworld (e.g., when
universities become governed by market strategies).
“Juridification” is another such pathological form, when
law comes to invade more and more areas of social life, turning
citizens into clients of bureaucracies with what Foucault might call
“normalizing” effects. This aspect of TCA has less
of an impact on Habermas's current work, which returns to the
theme of improving democratic practice as a means of counteracting
juridification and colonization. Democratic institutions, if properly
designed and robustly executed, are supposed to ensure that the law
does not take this pathological form but is subject to the deliberation
of citizens, who thus author the laws to which they are subject (see
sec. 3.4). 
After TCA, then, Habermas begins to see law not as part of
the problem, but as part of the solution, once he offers a more
complete discourse-theoretical account of law and democracy.
Nonetheless the theory of modernity still remains in his continued use
of systems theory and its understanding of nonintentional integration.
By insisting upon popular sovereignty as the outcome of the generation
of “communicative power” in the public sphere, Habermas
tries to save the substance of radical democracy. The unresolved
difficulty is that in a complex society, as Habermas asserts,
“public opinion does not rule” but rather points
administrative power in particular directions; or, as he puts it, it
does not “steer” but “countersteers”
institutional complexity (1996b, chapter 8). That is, citizens do not
control social processes; they exercise influence through particular
institutionalized mechanisms and channels of communication. However
successful democracy is in creating legitimacy, it cannot gain full
control over large-scale complex societies, nor even of the necessary
conditions for its own realization. In this sense, Habermas's
emphasis on the limiting effect of complexity on democracy and his
rejection of a fully democratic form of sociation continue the basic
argument of the necessity of systems integration, even with its costs.
Radical democracy may no longer be the only means to social
transformation, though it is clear that it remains “the
unfinished project of modernity”: realizing and transforming
democracy is still a genuine goal even for complex and globalizing
societies. 
Habermas's theory of communicative action rests on the idea
that social order ultimately depends on the capacity of actors to
recognize the intersubjective validity of the different claims on which
social cooperation depends. In conceiving cooperation in relation to
validity claims, Habermas highlights its rational and cognitive
character: to recognize the validity of such claims is to presume that
good reasons could be given to justify them in the face of criticism.
TCA thus points to and depends on an account of such
justification—that is, on a theory of argumentation or discourse,
which Habermas calls the “reflective form” of communicative
action. 
As mentioned above, Habermas proposes a multi-dimensional conception
of reason that expresses itself in different forms of cognitive
validity: not only in truth claims about the empirical world, but also
in rightness claims about the kind of treatment we owe each other as
persons, authenticity claims about the good life, technical-pragmatic
claims about the means suitable to different goals, and so on. As he
acknowledges, the surface grammar of speech acts does not suffice to
establish this range of validity types. Rather, to ground the
multi-dimensional system of validity claims, one must supplement
semantic analysis with a pragmatic analysis of the different sorts of
argumentative discourse—the different “logics of
argumentation”—through which each type can be
intersubjectively justified (TCA 1: 8–42). Thus, a type of
validity claim counts as distinct from other types only if one can
establish that its discursive justification involves features that
distinguish it from other types of justification. Whether or not his
pragmatic theory of meaning succeeds, the discursive analysis of
validity illuminates important differences in the argumentative demands
that come with different types of justifiable claims. To see how
Habermas identifies these different features, it is first necessary to
understand the general structures of argumentation.
The pragmatic analysis of argumentation in general.
Habermas's discourse theory assumes that the specific type of
validity claim one aims to justify—the cognitive goal or topic of
argumentation—determines the specific argumentative practices
appropriate for such justification. Discourse theory thus calls for a
pragmatic analysis of argumentation as a social practice. Such analysis
aims to reconstruct the normative presuppositions that structure the
discourse of competent arguers. To get at these presuppositions, one
cannot simply describe argumentation as it empirically occurs; as we
already saw in TCA, one must adopt the performative attitude
of a participant and articulate the shared, though often tacit, ideals
and rules that provide the basis for regarding some arguments as better
than others. Following contemporary argumentation theorists, Habermas
assumes one cannot fully articulate these normative presuppositions
solely in terms of the logical properties of arguments. Rather, he
distinguishes three aspects of argument-making practices: argument as
product, as procedure, and as process, which he loosely aligns with the
traditional perspectives on argument evaluation of logic, dialectic,
and rhetoric. Pragmatically, each of these perspectives functions as a
“level of presupposition” involved in the assessment of the
cogency—the goodness or strength—of arguments. Habermas
seems to regard these perspectives, taken together, as constituting the
pragmatic idea of cogency: “at no single one of these analytic
levels can the very idea intrinsic to argumentative speech be
adequately developed” (TCA 1: 26).
At the logical level, participants are concerned with
arguments as products, that is, sets of reasons that support
conclusions. From this perspective, arguers aim to construct
“cogent arguments that are convincing in virtue of their
intrinsic properties and with which validity claims can be redeemed or
rejected” (ibid., 25). Following work by Stephen Toulmin and
other informal logicians, Habermas regards most if not all
argumentation as ultimately resting on ampliative arguments whose
conclusions do not follow with deductive certainty but only as more or
less plausible or probable. The logical strength of such arguments
depends on how well one has taken into account all the relevant
information and possible objections. Thus the term
“logical” has a broad sense that includes not only formal
but also informal logics, in which strength depends on the interrelated
meanings of terms and background information that resists complete
formalization: induction, analogy, narrative, and so on.
Given the ampliative character of most arguments, logical assessment
presupposes the dialectical adequacy of argumentative procedures. That
is, we may regard the products of our argument-making practices as
logically strong only if we presume, at the dialectical level, that we
have submitted arguments and counterarguments to sufficiently severe
procedures of critical discussion—as Habermas (TCA 1:
26) puts it, a “ritualized competition for the better
arguments.” Dialectical treatments of argumentation typically
spell out the “dialectical obligations” of discussants:
that one should address the issue at hand, should respond to relevant
challenges, meet the specified burden of proof, and so on.
However, robust critical testing of competing arguments depends in
turn on the rhetorical quality of the persuasive process. Habermas
conceives the rhetorical level in terms of highly idealized properties
of communication, which he initially presented as the conditions of an
“ideal speech situation” (1973a; also 1971/2001). That way
of speaking now strikes him as overly reified, suggesting an ideal
condition that real discourses must measure up to, or at least
approximately satisfy—motifs that Habermas himself employed
until rather recently (cf. 1993, 54–55; 1996b, 322–23). He
now understands the idea of rhetorically adequate process as a set of
unavoidable yet counterfactual “pragmatic presuppositions”
that participants must make if they are to regard the actual execution
of dialectical procedures as a sufficiently severe critical
test. Habermas (2005b, 89) identifies four such presuppositions as the
most important: (i) no one capable of making a relevant contribution
has been excluded, (ii) participants have equal voice, (iii) they are
internally free to speak their honest opinion without deception or
self-deception, and (iv) there are no sources of coercion built into
the process and procedures of discourse. Such conditions, in effect,
articulate what it would mean to assess all the relevant information
and arguments (for a given level of knowledge and inquiry) as
reasonably as possible, weighing arguments purely on the merits in a
disinterested pursuit of truth. These conditions are counterfactual in
the sense that actual discourses can rarely realize—and can
never empirically certify—full inclusion, non-coercion, and
equality. At the same time, these idealizing presuppositions have an
operative effect on actual discourse: we may regard outcomes (both
consensual and non-consensual) as reasonable only if our scrutiny of
the process does not uncover obvious exclusions, suppression of
arguments, manipulation, self-deception, and the like (2003a, 108). In
this sense, these pragmatic idealizations function as
“standards for a self-correcting learning
process” (2005b, 91).
As an understanding of the rhetorical perspective, Habermas's
highly idealized and formal model hardly does justice to the
substantive richness of the rhetorical tradition. One can, however,
supplement his model with a more substantive rhetoric that draws on
Aristotle's account of ethos and pathos (Rehg 1997). In that
case, the rhetorical perspective is concerned with designing arguments
for their ability to place the particular audience in the proper
social-psychological space for making a responsible collective
judgment. Yet the “space of responsible judgment” still
remains an idealization that may not be reduced to any observable
actual behavior, but can at most be defeasibly presumed. The same
probably holds for dialectical procedures. Although the dialectical
perspective draws on the tradition of public debate, dialectical
norms, when understood as pragmatic presuppositions, are not identical
with institutionalized rules of debate (1990a, 91). A neutral observer
can judge whether interlocutors have externally complied with
institutional procedures, whereas engaged participants must judge how
well they have satisfied the dialectical presupposition of severe
critical testing.
The differentiation of argumentative discourses. If the
different validity claims require different types of argumentation,
then the relevant differences must emerge through a closer analysis of
the ways the above aspects of argumentative practice adjust to
different sorts of content, that is, the different validity claims at
issue (cf. 2008, chap. 3). To be sure, Habermas does not regard every
validity claim as open to discourse proper. Sincerity claims (or
“truthfulness claims,” as it is sometimes translated) are
the prime example. These are claims an actor makes about his or her
interior subjectivity: feelings, moods, desires, beliefs, and the like.
Such claims are open to rational assessment, not in discourse but by
comparison with the actor's behavior: for example, if a son
claims to care deeply about his parents but never pays them any
attention, we would have grounds for doubting the sincerity of his
claim. Note that such insincerity might involve self-deception rather
than deliberate lying.
Truth and rightness claims, by contrast, are susceptible to
argumentative justification in the proper sense, through what Habermas
calls “strict discourses.” As he first analyzed the
discourses connected with these two types of validity (1973a), they had
much in common. Although the types of reasons differed—moral
discourse rested primarily on need interpretations,
empirical-theoretical discourse on empirical inductions—in both
cases, the relevant reasons should, in principle, be acceptable to any
reasonable agent. In the case of empirical truth claims, this
process-level presupposition of consensus rests on the idea that the
objective world is the same for all; in the case of moral rightness, it
rests on the idea that valid moral rules and principles hold for all
persons. In both cases, the appropriate audience for the testing of
claims is universal, and in making a truth or rightness claim one
counterfactually presupposes that a universal consensus would result,
were the participants able to pursue a sufficiently inclusive and
reasonable discourse for a sufficient length of time. Although his
early statements are somewhat unclear, on one reading Habermas defined
not only moral rightness but also empirical truth in terms of such
ideal consensus (similar to C. S. Peirce). He now further distinguishes
truth from moral rightness by defining the latter, but not the former,
in terms of idealized consensus. More on that below.
Authenticity claims, unlike truth and rightness claims, do not come
with such a strong consensual expectation. Habermas associates this
type of claim with “ethical” discourse. Unlike moral
discourse, in which participants strive to justify norms and courses of
action that accord due concern and respect for persons in general,
ethical discourses focus on questions of the good life, either for a
given individual (“ethical-existential” discourse) or for a
particular group or polity (“ethical-political” discourse).
Consequently, the kind of reasons that constitute cogent arguments in
ethical discourse depend on the life histories, traditions, and
particular values of those whose good is at issue. This reference to
individual- and group-related particularities means that one should not
expect those reasons to win universal consensus (1993, 1–18; 1996b,
162–68). However, Habermas (2003b) seems to recognize one class of
ethical questions that do admit of universal consensus. Choices of
technologies that bear on the future of human nature, such as genetic
enhancement engineering, pose species-wide ethical issues. Such issues
concern not merely our self-understanding as members of this or that
particular culture or tradition, but how we should understand our basic
human dignity. In his view, the core of human dignity, and thus the basis for a
human-species ethics, lies in the capacity of human beings
for autonomous self-determination.
In sum, Habermas's discourse theory aligns different types of
validity claim with different types of justificatory discourse. At the
logical level, cogent arguments must employ somewhat different sorts of
reasons to justify different types of claims. Although some sorts of
reasons might enter into each type of discourse (e.g., empirical
claims), the set of relevant considerations that are individually
necessary and jointly sufficient for making logically strong arguments
will differ. Thus, claims about what human beings need are relevant
reasons in moral arguments about welfare obligations, but not for
supporting the truth claim that quarks exist. At the dialectical level,
one must meet different burdens of proof by answering different types
of challenges. For example, in defending the ethical authenticity of
Tom's pursuit of a career in medicine, one need not show that
medicine is a career everyone must follow, but only that such a career
makes sense, given Tom's personal background, talents, and
desires. One can also examine Tom's career choice from a moral
perspective, but in that case one need only show that anyone in his
circumstances is morally permitted to pursue medicine. At the
rhetorical level, finally, the scope and depth of agreement differs
according to the type of claim. Moral rightness claims and empirical
truth claims are justified by reasons that should be acceptable to a
universal audience, whereas ethical claims are addressed to those who
share a particular history and tradition of values. 
Having differentiated types of discourse, Habermas must say something
about how they interrelate. Clearly, some discourses depend on other
types: most obviously, moral and ethical discourses partly depend on
empirical claims, and thus depend on the outcome of empirical
discourses about the circumstances and consequences of behavioral rules
and the collective pursuit of the good life. The question of
interrelationship becomes especially urgent in the political sphere,
where different discourses intertwine and lead to competing
conclusions, or when issues arise in which discourse types cannot be
cleanly separated, so that the standards of cogency become obscure or
deeply contested (McCarthy 1991, chap. 7; 1998). Because Habermas
(1996c, 1534f) rejects the idea of a metadiscourse that sorts out these
boundary issues, he must answer this challenge in his democratic
theory. Before taking up that topic, Habermas's theory of truth
deserves a closer look.
In his various essays on empirical truth, Habermas usually regards
propositions as the truth-bearer: in making an assertion, “I am
claiming that the proposition [Aussage] that I am asserting is
true” (1971/2001, 86; cf. 2003a, 249ff). In his early treatment,
however, he immediately equated empirical truth with ideal
justifiability—the consensus theory of truth mentioned above.
According to that theory, the “truth condition of propositions is
the potential assent of all others”; thus “the
universal-pragmatic meaning of truth…is determined by the demand
of reaching a rational consensus” (1971/2001, 89; cf. 86). Such
formulations suggest that Habermas equated the meaning of truth with
the outcome of a universal, rational consensus, which he understood in
reference to the ideal speech situation (ibid., 97–98). However, he
soon saw the difficulties with consensus theory, and he never allowed
“Wahrheitstheorien” (1973a), his main essay on the
consensus theory of truth, to appear in English. Like the
“epistemic” theories of truth that link truth with ideal
warranted assertibility (e.g., Hilary Putnam, Crispin Wright),
consensus theory downplays the justification-transcendent character of
truth (2003a, 250–52). 
Habermas now proposes instead a “pragmatic epistemological
realism” (2003a, 7; 1998b, chap. 8). His theory of truth is
realist in holding that the objective world, rather than ideal
consensus, is the truth-maker. If a proposition (or sentence,
statement) for which we claim truth is indeed true, it is so because it
accurately refers to existing objects, or accurately represents actual
states of affairs—albeit objects and states of affairs about
which we can state facts only under descriptions that depend on our
linguistic resources. The inescapability of language dictates the
pragmatic epistemological character of his realism. Specifically,
Habermas eschews the attempt to explicate the relationship between
proposition and world metaphysically (e.g., as in correspondence
theories). Rather, he explicates the meaning of accurate representation
pragmatically, in terms of its implications for everyday practice and
discourse. Insofar as we take propositional contents as
unproblematically true in our daily practical engagement with reality,
we act confidently on the basis of well-corroborated beliefs about
objects in the world. What Habermas (1971/2001, 94; TCA 1: 23)
calls “theoretico-empirical” or “theoretical”
discourse becomes necessary when beliefs lose their unproblematic
status as the result of practical difficulties, or when novel
circumstances pose questions about the natural world. Such cases call
for an empirical inquiry in which truth claims about the world are
submitted to critical testing. Although Habermas tends to sharply
separate action and discourse, it seems more plausible to regard such
critical testing as combining discourse with experimental
actions—as we see in scientific inquiry, which combines empirical
arguments with practical actions, that is, field studies and
laboratory experimentation. 
To date Habermas has not drawn out the implications of his discourse
theory for a detailed account of truth-oriented discourses, which we
find most highly developed in the sciences (but see Rehg 2009,
chaps. 4–6). As an argumentation theory, such an account would
probably have to take the following broad lines: at the logical level,
the discursive justification of problematic truth claims heavily
relies on empirical reasons: observation reports, results of
experimental tests, and the like. Similarly for the dialectical level:
the chief challenges arise from theories and observations that
seemingly conflict with the claim at issue or with its supporting
reasons. At the rhetorical level, one seeks the agreement of a
potentially universal audience, given that truth claims are about an
objective world that is the same for all human beings.  This sketch,
however, leaves out precisely the details that would make a discourse
theory of science interesting. For example, how do epistemic and
aesthetic values (scope, accuracy, simplicity, etc.)  affect the
logical construction of scientific arguments? Must not the
presupposition of a universal audience be attenuated, given that
scientists investigate aspects of the world (e.g., subatomic
particles) that are inaccessible to all but a small group of trained
experts? How does the cogency of scientific arguments depend on or
involve various institutional structures and mechanisms, such as peer
review, assignment of credit, distribution of grant money, and so
on? 
Habermas's two enduring interests in political theory and
rationality come together in his discourse theory of deliberative
democracy. There we see him struggling to show how his highly
idealized, multi-dimensional discourse theory has real institutional
purchase in complex, modern societies. In that context, argumentation
appears in the form of public discussion and debate over practical
questions that confront political bodies. The challenge, then, is to
show how an idealized model of practical discourse connects with real
institutional contexts of decision-making. 
Habermas summarizes his idealized conception of practical discourse
in the “discourse principle” (D), which we might state as
follows: A rule of action or choice is justified, and thus valid, only
if all those affected by the rule or choice could accept it in a
reasonable discourse. Although he first understood (D) as a principle
of moral discourse, he now positions it as an overarching principle of
impartial justification that holds for all types of practical discourse
(cf. 1990a, 66, 93; 1996b, 107). As such, it simply summarizes his
argumentation theory for any question involving the various
“employments of practical reason” (1993, chap. 1). (D) thus
applies not only to moral rightness and ethical authenticity, but also
to the justification of technical-pragmatic claims about the choice of
effective means for achieving a given end. Each type of practical
discourse then involves a further specification of (D) for the content
at issue. In developing his democratic theory, Habermas has been
especially concerned with two such specifications: moral discourse and
legal-political discourse. In distinguishing these two types of
discourse, Habermas tackles the traditional problem of the relationship
between law and morality. He also shows how to bring ethereal
discursive idealizations down to institutional earth. We start with his
account of moral discourse.
Habermas's discourse ethics. Habermas's
discourse theory of morality generally goes by the name
“discourse ethics,” a somewhat misleading label given that
“ethics” has a distinct non-moral sense for him, as noted
above. The idea of a discourse ethics was anticipated by G. H. Mead
(1962, 379–89) and has been pursued by a number of philosophers (e.g., see
Apel 1990, Benhabib 1992; Wingert 1993; Forst 2012). Habermas's version is heavily
indebted to the Kantian tradition. Like Kant, he considers morality a
matter of unconditional moral obligations: the prohibitions, positive
obligations, and permissions that regulate interaction among persons.
The task of moral theory is to reconstruct the unconditional force of
such obligations as impartial dictates of practical reason that hold
for any similarly situated agent. Also like Kant, Habermas links
morality with respect for autonomous agency: in following the dictates
of impartial reason, one follows one's own conscience and shows
respect for other such agents. Unlike Kant, however, Habermas takes a
dialogical approach to practical reason, as his discourse theory
requires. Kant assumed that in principle each mature, reflective
individual, guided by the Categorical Imperative, could reach the same
conclusions about what duty requires. This assumption has long been
recognized as problematic, but in pluralistic and multicultural
settings it becomes entirely untenable: one may plausibly claim to take
an impartial moral point of view only by engaging in real discourse
with all those affected by the issue in question. 
Habermas's (D)-Principle articulates this dialogical
requirement. If one assumes this requirement, then one can arrive at
Habermas's specific conception of reasonable moral discourse by
working out the implications of his argumentation theory for the
discursive testing of unconditional moral obligations. What one gets
is a dialogical principle of universalization
(U): “A [moral norm] is valid just in case the foreseeable
consequences and side-effects of its general observance for the
interests and value-orientations of each individual could be
jointly accepted by all concerned without
coercion” (i.e., in a sufficiently reasonable discourse) (1998a,
42; trans. amended). Habermas maintains that (U) can be deduced from
statements articulating the pragmatic implications of argumentative
discourse over moral norms (1990a, 86–93; 1998a,
39–45). More precisely, a successful deduction probably depends
on three assumptions: (D), a statement of the semantics of
unconditional norms, and an articulation of the pragmatics of
discourse (Rehg 2011; cf. Ott 2004). If we accept (D) and if we accept
Habermas's explication of the rhetorical presuppositions of the
discursive justification required by (D), then (U) would have to
follow as an implication of what is required for discursively
justifying norms with the specific content of moral norms, namely
obligations that bind persons in general and whose acceptance thus
affects each person's pursuit of interests and the good life. From the
standpoint of argumentation theory, (U) seems to state the burden of
proof that structures an adequate process and procedure of
justification.
The (U)-Principle assumes that valid moral rules or norms allow for an
egalitarian community of autonomous agents—as Kant put it, a
“systematic union of different rational beings” governed
by “common laws” (1785, Ak. 433; also 431). However, the
(U)-Principle has been a site of controversy among discourse
theorists, and not everyone considers it necessary for a discourse
ethics (Benhabib and Dallmayr 1990; Wellmer 1991; Gottschalk-Mazouz
2000). Some feminist proponents of an "ethics of care" have worried
that Habermas's neo-Kantian model of universalization screens out
morally relevant particularities of concrete situations and persons
(Young 1990; Benhabib 1992, chap. 5).
Whether or not the argument for (U) goes through, Habermas's
discourse ethics depends on some very strong assumptions about the
capacity of persons for moral dialogue. Given that his discourse theory
in general, and thus (U) in particular, rests on counterfactual
idealizations, one might be tempted to regard (U) as a hypothetical
thought experiment, analogous to what we find in other neo-Kantian or
contractualist theories like those of John Rawls and T. M. Scanlon. To
some extent this is correct: to regard a moral norm as valid, one must
presume it would hold up in a fully inclusive and reasonable discourse.
But Habermas takes a further step, insisting that (U) is a principle of
real discourse: an individual's moral judgment counts as fully
reasonable only if it issues from participation in actual discourse
with all those affected. Moreover, (U) requires not simply that one
seek the input of others in forming one's conscience, but that
one gain their reasonable agreement. 
To bring such strong idealizations down to earth, one must connect
them with conscientious judgment in everyday moral practice. One way
to do this is through an account of the appropriate application of
moral rules in concrete circumstances. In response to ethics-of-care
objections (and following Günther 1993), Habermas has
acknowledged the need for such an account (1993, 35–39). In
moral discourses of application, one must test alternative normative
interpretations of the particular situation for their acceptability
before the limited audience of those immediately involved, on the
assumption that one is applying valid general norms. But even at the
level of application, discourse cannot always include all the affected
parties (e.g., when the issue concerns the fate of a comatose
patient).  Habermas's discourse ethics thus implies that for many, if
not most, of our moral rules and choices, the best we can achieve are
partial justifications: arguments that are not conclusively convincing
for all, but also are not conclusively defeated, in limited
discourses with interlocutors we regard as reasonable (cf. Rehg 2003,
2004). 
Habermas has also attempted to give discourse ethics some empirical
foothold by looking to moral psychology and social anthropology
(1990a, 116–94). The psychological line of argument draws on the
theory of communicative action to reconstruct theories of moral
development such as Lawrence Kohlberg's. According to Habermas, moral
maturation involves the growing ability to integrate the interpersonal
perspectives given with the system of personal pronouns; the endpoint
of that process coincides with the capacity to engage in the mutual
perspective-taking required by (U). The anthropological line of
argument focuses on identity formation, drawing on the social
psychology of G. H. Mead. In broad agreement with Hegelian models of
mutual recognition, Mead understands the individual's development of a
stable personal identity as inextricably bound up with processes of
socialization that depend on participation in relationships of mutual
recognition. Habermas extends this analysis to respond to feminist and
communitarian criticisms of impartialist, justice-based moralities
(ibid., 195–215; 1990b). Such moralities, critics allege, assume
an implausibly atomistic view of the self. Thus they fail to
appreciate the moral import of particularity and cultural substance:
particular relationships between unique individuals, on the one hand,
and membership in particular cultural communities or traditions, on
the other (for feminist critiques, see Benhabib 1992; Meehan 1995; for
a communitarian argument, see Taylor 1989). Mead's analysis shows that
the critics are on to an important point: if individuation depends on
socialization, then any anthropologically viable system of morality
must protect not only the integrity of individuals but also the web of
relationships and cultural forms of life on which individuals depend
for their moral development. Discourse ethics, Habermas claims, meets
this two-fold demand in virtue of the kind of mutual
perspective-taking it requires. If we examine (U), we see that it
requires participants to attend to the values and interests of each
person as a unique individual; conversely, each individual conditions
her judgment about the moral import of her values and interests on
what all participants can freely accept. Consequently, moral discourse
is structured in a way that links moral validity with solidaristic
concern for both the concrete individual and the morally formative
communities on which her identity depends.
These arguments are certainly ambitious, and they raise as many
questions as they answer. It is hardly surprising, then, that many
commentators have not been persuaded by discourse ethics as a
normative ethics. Rather, they regard it as plausible only in the
context of democratic politics, or as a model for the critical
evaluation of formal dialogues (e.g., environmental conflict
resolution, medical ethics committees, and the like). Other critics
have targeted discourse ethics at a metaethical level. In fact,
Habermas first unveiled his moral theory in answer to moral
non-cognitivism and skepticism (1990a, 43–115). In this context,
(U) explicates a moral epistemology: what it means for moral
statements to count as justified. If moral statements are justifiable,
then they have a cognitive character in the sense that they are
correct or not depending on how they fare in reasonable
discourse. However, Habermas proposes (U) not merely as articulating a
consensus model of moral justification, but as an explication of the
meaning of rightness itself. Unlike truth, the rightness of a moral
norm does not consist in reference to an independently existing realm
of objects, but rather in the worthiness of the norm for
intersubjective recognition. Thus rightness, unlike truth, means ideal
warranted assertibility (2005b, 93; 2003a, chap. 6). This antirealist
interpretation of discourse ethics has been challenged, however, with
some critics advocating a realist interpretation of rightness, others
a deflationary approach (Lafont 1999, chap. 7; Heath 1998).  
Habermas's discourse theory of law and politics. The
central task of Habermas's democratic theory is to provide a
normative account of legitimate law. His deliberative democratic model
rests on what is perhaps the most complex argument in his philosophical
corpus, found in his Between Facts and Norms (1996b; German
ed., 1992b; for commentary, see Baynes 1995; Rosenfeld and Arato 1998;
vom Schomberg and Baynes 2004). Boiled down to its essentials, however,
the argument links his discourse theory with an analysis of the demands
inherent in modern legal systems, which Habermas understands in light
of the history of Western modernization. The analysis thus begins with
a functional explanation of the need for positive law in modern
societies. This analysis picks up on points he made in TCA
(see sec. 3.1 above).
Societies are stable over the long run only if their members
generally perceive them as legitimate: as organized in accordance with
what is true, right, and good. In premodern Europe, legitimacy was
grounded in a shared religious worldview that penetrated all spheres of
life. As modernization engendered religious pluralism and functional
differentiation (autonomous market economies, bureaucratic
administrations, unconstrained scientific research), the potentials for
misunderstanding and conflict about the good and the right
increased—just as the shared background resources for the
consensual resolution of such conflicts decreased. When we consider
this dynamic simply from the standpoint of the (D)-principle, the
prospects for legitimacy in modern societies appear quite dim. 
Sociologically, then, one can understand modern law as a functional
solution to the conflict potentials inherent in modernization. By
opening up legally defined spheres of individual freedom, modern law
reduces the burden of questions that require general (society-wide)
discursive consensus. Within these legal boundaries, individuals are
free to pursue their interests and happiness as they see fit, normally
through various modes of association, whether that pursuit is primarily
governed by modes of strategic action (as in economic markets), by
recognized authority or consensual discourse (e.g., within religious
communities; in the sciences), or by bureaucratic rationality (as in
hierarchically organized voluntary enterprises). Consequently, modern
law is fundamentally concerned with the definition, protection, and
reconciliation of individual freedoms in their various
institutional and organizational contexts. 
The demands on the legitimation of law change with this functional
realignment: to be legitimate, modern law must secure the
private autonomy of those subject to it. The legal
guarantee of private autonomy in turn presupposes an established legal
code and a legally defined status of equal citizenship in terms of
actionable basic rights that secure a space for individual freedom.
However, such rights are expressions of freedom only if citizens can
also understand themselves as the authors of the laws that interpret
their rights—that is, only if the laws that protect private
autonomy also issue from citizens' exercise of public
autonomy as lawmakers acting through elected representatives. Thus,
the rights that define individual freedom must also include rights of
political participation. As Habermas understands the relation between
private and public autonomy, each is “co-original” or
“equiprimordial,” conceptually presupposing the other in
the sense that each can be fully realized only if the other is fully
realized. The exercise of public autonomy in its full sense
presupposes participants who understand themselves as individually
free (privately autonomous), which in turn presupposes that they can
shape their individual freedoms through the exercise of public
autonomy. This equiprimordial relationship, Habermas
believes, enables his discourse theory to combine the best insights of
the civic republican and classical liberal traditions of democracy,
which found expression in Rousseau and Locke, respectively (1998a, chap. 9).
Habermas (1996b, chap. 3) understands these rights of liberty and
political participation as an abstract system of basic rights generated
by reflection on the nature of discursive legitimation (articulated in
the D-Principle) in contexts shaped by the functional demands on modern
law (or the “form” of positive law). Because these rights
are abstract, each polity must further interpret and flesh them out for
its particular historical circumstances, perhaps supplementing them
with further welfare and environmental rights. In any case, the system
of rights constitutes a minimum set of normative institutional
conditions for any legitimate modern political order. The system of
rights, in other words, articulates the normative framework for
constitutional democracies, within which further institutional
mechanisms such as legislatures and other branches of government must
operate.
The idea of public autonomy means that the legitimacy of ordinary
legislation must ultimately be traceable to robust processes of public
discourse that influence formal decisionmaking in legislative bodies.
Habermas summarizes this requirement in his democratic principle of
legitimacy: “only those statutes may claim legitimacy that can
meet with the assent of all citizens in a discursive process of
legislation that in turn has been legally constituted” (1996b,
110). As he goes on to explain, this principle articulates the core
requirement for “externally” institutionalizing the
different types of practical discourse that are relevant for the
justification of particular laws. Decisions about laws typically
involve a combination of validity claims: not only truth claims about
the likely consequences of different legal options, but also claims
about their moral rightness (or justice), claims about the authenticity
of different options in light of the polity's shared values and
history, and pragmatic claims about which option is feasible or more
efficient. Legitimate laws must pass the different types of discursive
tests that come with each of these validity claims. Habermas also
recognizes that many issues involve conflicts among particular
interests that cannot be reconciled by discursive agreement on validity
but only through fair bargaining processes. 
This strong orientation toward cognitive validity qualifies Habermas's
version of deliberative democracy as an “epistemic”
theory. This puts his democratic principle in a rather puzzling
position. On the one hand, it represents a specification of the
discourse principle for a particular kind of discourse
(legal-political discourse). This makes it analogous to the moral
principle (U), which specifies (D) for moral discourse. As a specific
principle of reasonable discourse, the democratic principle seems to
have the character of an idealizing presupposition insofar as it
presumes the possibility of consensual decisionmaking in politics.
For Habermas, reasonable political discourse must at least begin with
the supposition that legal questions admit in principle of single
right answers (1996c, 1491–95), or at least a set of
discursively valid answers on which a fair compromise, acceptable to
all parties, is possible. This highly cognitive, consensualist
presumption has drawn fire even from sympathetic commentators. One
difficulty lies in Habermas's assumption that in public discourse over
controversial political issues, citizens can separate the moral
constraints on acceptable solutions, presumably open to general
consensus, from ethical-political and pragmatic considerations, over
which reasonable citizens may reasonably disagree. As various critics
have pointed out, this distinction is very hard to maintain in
practice, and perhaps in theory as well (Bohman 1996; McCarthy 1998;
Warnke 1999).
On the other hand, the democratic principle lies at a different level
from principles like (U), as Habermas himself emphasizes (1996b,
110). The latter specify (D) for this or that single type of practical
discourse, in view of internal cognitive demands on justification,
whereas the former pulls together all the forms of practical discourse
and sets forth conditions on their
external institutionalization. From this perspective, the
democratic principle acts as a bridge that links the cognitive aspects
of political discourse (as a combination of the different types of
idealized discourse) with the demands of institutional realization in
complex societies. As such, the democratic principle should refer not
to consensus, but rather to something like a warranted presumption of
reasonableness. In fact, in a number of places Habermas describes
democratic legitimacy in just such terms, which we might paraphrase as
follows: citizens may regard their laws as legitimate insofar as the
democratic process, as it is institutionally organized and conducted,
warrants the presumption that outcomes are reasonable products of a
sufficiently inclusive deliberative process of opinion- and
will-formation (2008, 103). The presumption of reasonable outcomes
thus rests not so much on the individual capacities of citizens to act
like the participants of ideal discourse, but rather on the aggregate
reasonableness of a “subjectless communication” that
emerges as the collective result of discursive structures—the
formal and informal modes of organizing discussion (1996b,
184–86, 301, 341). This means that democracy is
“decentered,” no longer fully under control of its own
conditions and no longer based on a congruent subject of
self-legislating discourse.
Habermas dubs his position an “epistemic proceduralism.”
The position is proceduralist because collective reasonableness
emerges from the operation of the democratic process; it is epistemic
insofar as that process results in collective learning. The latter
presupposes a fruitful interplay of three major discursive arenas: the
dispersed communication of citizens in civil society; the
“media-based mass communication” in the political public
sphere; and the institutionalized discourse of lawmakers. When these
arenas work well together, civil society and the public sphere
generate a set of considered public opinions that then influence the
deliberation of lawmakers (2009). In light of the above ambiguity in
the status of (D), however, one might want to take a more pragmatic
approach to democratic deliberation. Such an approach (e.g., Bohman
1996; McCarthy 1998) understands deliberation as less a matter of
settling disputes over the cognitive validity of competing proposals
than a matter of developing legal frameworks within which citizens can
continue to cooperate despite disagreements about what is right or
good. 
Habermas's discourse theory also has implications for
international modes of deliberation—hence for the debate about a
potential cosmopolitan political order. To understand his position in
this debate, it helps to sketch a typology of the main theories. The
current discussion moves along four main axes: political or social,
institutional or noninstitutional, democratic or nondemocratic, and
transnational or cosmopolitan. Theories are informed by background
assumptions about the scope of cosmopolitanism: whether it is moral to
the extent that it is concerned with individuals and their life
opportunities, social to the extent that it makes associations and
institutions central, or political to the extent that it focuses on
specifically legal and political institutions, including citizenship.
Habermas's position in this debate is moderate. It is not minimal
in the sense of Rawls's law of peoples, which denies the need for
any strong international legal or political order, much less a
democratic one. Nor is it a strongly democratic position, such as David
Held's version of cosmopolitan order. However, both Held and
Habermas share a common emphasis on the emergence of international
public law as central to a just global political order.
In his essay “Kant's Idea of Perpetual Peace: At Two
Hundred Years' Historical Remove” (1998a, chap. 7; German
ed., 1996a, chap. 7), Habermas was optimistic about the prospects for a
global political order as the continuation of the form of democracy
based on human rights typical of nation states. Democracy on the
nation-state model connects three central ideas: that the proper
political community is a bounded one; that it possesses ultimate
political authority; and that this authority enables political
autonomy, so that the members of the demos may freely choose
the conditions of their own association and legislate for themselves.
The normative core of this conception of democracy lies in the
conception of freedom articulated in the third condition: that the
subject of legal constraints is free precisely in being the author of
the laws. Earlier we introduced Habermas's argument for
“decentering” democracy under the conditions of pluralism
and complexity. If this applies to the modern state, then it would seem
that cosmopolitan democracy would take this trend even further. Yet,
when discussing “postnational” legitimacy, Habermas clearly
makes self-determination by a singular demos the fundamental
normative core of the democratic ideal.
For Held (1995), cosmopolitan democracy is clearly continuous with
democracy, at least in form, as it is realized within states. Not only
does Held show how international society is already thickly
institutionalized well beyond the systems of negotiation that Habermas
makes central, he further recognizes that “individuals
increasingly have complex and multilayered identities, corresponding to
the globalization of economic forces and the reconfiguration of
political power.” Such potentially overlapping identities provide
the basis for participation in global civil society, in nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs), and in other transnational civil associations,
movements, and agencies that create opportunities for political
participation at the global level. Held's approach thus has three
enormous advantages: an emphasis on a variety of institutions; a
multiplicity of levels and sites for common democratic activity; and a
focus on the need for organized political actors in international civil
society to play an important role in a system of global democracy. For
all these advantages, the self-legislating demos reappears in
Held's explicitly Lockean insistence that “the artificial
person at the center of the modern state must be reconceived in terms
of cosmopolitan public law.” In order to reconstitute the
community as sovereign, Held argues that the demoi must submit
to the will of the global demos: “cosmopolitan law
demands the subordination of regional, national and local sovereignties
to an overarching legal framework.” 
Contrary to his earlier essay on Kant's Perpetual Peace, Habermas has
now pulled back from Held's strong conception of cosmopolitanism. In
The Postnational Constellation (2001a; German ed., 1998c) and
more recent essays on the European Union, Habermas seeks to
accommodate a wider institutional pluralism. Still, he cannot have it
both ways. When considering various disaggregated and distributed
forms of transnational political order, he describes them in
nondemocratic terms, as a “negotiating system” governed by
fair bargaining. This is because he clearly, and indeed surprisingly,
makes self-determination through legislation the deciding criterion of
democracy. Consequently, at the transnational level, the fundamental
form of political activity is negotiation among democracies. This
demos is at best a civic, rather than political,
transnational order. Nonetheless, Habermas links the possibility of a
“postnational democracy” to a shared and therefore
particular political identity, without which, he contends, we are left
with mere “moral” rather than “civic”
solidarity. According to Habermas, even if such a political community
is based on the universal principles of a democratic constitution,
“it still forms a collective identity, in the sense that it
interprets and realizes these principles in light of its own history
and in the context of its own particular form of life” (2001a,
117, 107). Without a common ethical basis, institutions beyond the
state must look to a “less demanding basis of legitimacy in the
organizational forms of an international negotiation system,”
the deliberative processes of which will be accessible to various
publics and to organizations in international civil society (ibid.,
109). 
More recently, he argues that regulatory political institutions at
the global level could be effective only if they take on features of
governance without government, even if human rights as juridical
statuses must be constitutionalized in the international system (2004,
130–31). As in the case of Allen Buchanan's minimalism, this less
demanding standard of legitimacy does not include the capacity to
deliberate about the terms governing the political authority of the
negotiation system itself. This position is transnational, but
ultimately nondemocratic, primarily because it restricts its overly
robust deliberative democracy to the level of the nation state. The
stronger criteria for democracy are not applied outside the nation
state, where governance is only indirectly democratic and left to
negotiations and policy networks. Furthermore, the commitment to human
rights as legal statuses pushes Habermas in the direction of
Held's fundamentally legal form of political cosmopolitanism. At
the moment, Habermas's view of cosmopolitan politics is not yet
fully stable. But it is clear that he thinks that a cosmopolitan order
must be political (and not merely juridical); institutional (and not
merely organized informally or by policy networks); transnational (to
the extent that it would be like the European Union, an order of
political and legal orders); and in some sense democratic or at least
subject to democratic norms. However, in order for him to fully adopt
this last characteristic of the international system, he will have to
rethink his conception of democracy as self-legislation. If he does not
do so, it seems impossible to fit democracy onto a transnational rather
than fully Kantian cosmopolitan order.
On the topic of religion, Habermas has taken a nuanced position that
continues to develop. In his Theory of Communicative Action,
he treated religion primarily from a sociological perspective, as an
archaic mode of social integration. Since then, however, he has
explored the role of religion in politics, on the one hand, and the
relationships between religious and philosophical modes of discourse,
on the other.
As a philosopher, Habermas has described his approach as a
“methodological atheism,” by which he means a kind of
experiment in radical demythologization whose outcome remains open.
Taking this stance does not make him hostile or dismissive of faith and
theological reflection; on the contrary, he grants that “indispensable
potentials for meaning are preserved in religious
language”—potentials that, at least so far, have not been
fully reduced to philosophical and secular reasons (2002, 77, 162). At
the same time, Habermas insists on the difference between theological
and philosophical modes of discourse: as a reflection on faith,
theology must not renounce its basis in religious experience and
ritual. Consequently, he resists apologetic attempts to generate
religious belief from philosophical premises. Rather, philosophers must
satisfy themselves with the “transcendence from within”
given with the context-transcending force of claims to truth and moral
rightness. 
Habermas has further developed his views on the relation between
philosophy and faith in his dialogue with Cardinal Ratzinger (who
would become Pope Benedict XVI)(2006b; German ed., 2005a; see also
2008, chap. 4). There he notes how much Western philosophy owes to its
Christian heritage, which philosophers assimilated by developing ideas
of “responsibility, autonomy and justification; history and
remembering; new beginning, innovation, and return; alienation,
internalization, and incarnation; individuality and community”
(2006b, 44; trans. amended). The Christian idea of human beings as
created in the image of God has been especially important for Western
moral-political theory, which translated the religious idea into the
secular view of persons as equal in dignity and deserving
unconditional respect (ibid., 45). This assimilation of Christian
ideas does not gut their substance, however.  In fact, religious
communities still harbor potentials of meaning from which philosophy
can learn—potentials that have “been lost elsewhere and
that cannot be restored by the professional knowledge of experts
alone” (ibid., 43). As examples, he refers to the
“differentiated possibilities of expression” and
“sensitivities” regarding “lives that have gone
astray, societal pathologies, the failure of individual life projects,
and the deformation of misbegotten human relationships” (ibid.,
trans. amended). In acknowledging that religious modes of expression
can harbor an integral cognitive content that is not exhausted by
secular translations, Habermas seems to have located the boundaries of
his methodological experiment in demythologization. He thus calls for
a dialogue in which secular and religious forms of thought mutually
inform and learn from each other. 
This broad point on the relation between religious and secular modes
of thought flows directly into the position Habermas takes in his
“Religion in the Public Sphere“ regarding the relation
between religion and public reasons (2006a; German ed., 2005b,
chap. 5). At the center of contention are the duties of believing
citizens to translate their religiously based claims into secular,
publicly accessible reasons. Habermas stakes out his position between
John Rawls and Robert Audi, on the one side, and Paul Weithmann and
Nicholas Wolterstorff, on the other.
Audi places the heaviest burden on believers, requiring them to
support only those laws for which they have sufficient public reasons;
each citizen thus has a duty to translate religiously based arguments
into secular ones. In his final statement on this issue, Rawls (1997)
presents a “wide view” of public reason, according to which
citizens may introduce reasons from reasonable comprehensive doctrines
(which can include religious views), without translation, at any time
into public discourse about constitutional essentials, provided that at
some point in the future these reasons are translated into generally
accessible public arguments. For Habermas, Audi and Rawls underestimate
the existential force of religious belief—how such belief can, at
least for some believers, provide the only sufficient basis for their
political views, even when public reasons might also be taken as
supporting the views in question. The demand that believers translate
their comprehensive religious views into secular justifications imposes
undue burdens on believers of this sort. The demand for translation,
rather, pertains only to politicians and public officials with
institutional power to make, apply, and execute the law. 
As Habermas reads them, Weithmann and Wolterstorff take the opposite
line from Rawls and Audi, opening up public discourse to untranslated
religious arguments. Weithmann requires believers to argue for their
positions as good for everyone, but he allows them to frame such
arguments within their religiously based conception of justice.
Wolterstorff removes even this mild constraint. Both thinkers do not
impose any institutional filter: not only in the public sphere but also
in the halls of power, religious reasons can suffice to justify
coercive legal and administrative decisions. This move, Habermas
maintains, undoes the neutrality principle that undergirds modern
constitutional democracy, with its separation of church and state: the
idea that “all enforceable political decisions must be
formulated in a language that is equally accessible to all
citizens, and it must be possible to justify them in this
language as well” (2006a, 12). Indeed, Wolterstorff seems to
reject a key idea behind democratic legitimation, namely the
presumption that procedures and decisions should operate within a
background framework of principles acceptable to all citizens.
Consequently, it is unclear how a democracy should maintain its
legitimacy and avoid devolving into an endless strife of factions
simply vying for power.
In the background of these debates lay contention over the burdens
of citizenship. Believers might object that Habermas still places an
asymmetric burden on them. After all, they must eventually, at the
institutional level, shift over to secular modes of justification,
whereas non-believers need not carry out the same kind of move toward
religious justification. In response, Habermas has offered the
hypothesis that both believers and non-believers are involved in a
complementary learning process in which each side can learn from the
other. As a cooperative learning process, translation makes demands on
both sides: the believer must seek publicly accessible arguments,
whereas the non-believer must approach religion as a potential source
of meaning, as harboring truths about human existence that are relevant
for all. 
In closing, we suggest three possible extensions to Habermas's
reply to believers. First, one might note that in the West at least,
Christians are not so burdened as one might think. After all, some of
the most important secular ideas that inform constitutional
democracy—ideas of inalienable individual rights, liberty, and
the like—partly originated in Christianity. Second, one might
point out that a reverse duty of translation on non-believers would
involve a far heavier burden than that on believers, particularly in
light of the first point. This is because some religious reasons,
though they might have a surface intelligibility as propositions to
non-believers, cannot be adequately appreciated or weighed apart from
prolonged experience of living the faith. Although it remains important
for non-believers to learn from believers, one should probably expect
believers to have an epistemic advantage in the translation process,
that is, the process of determining whether or not a given secular
content adequately renders a religiously based reason. So if believers
have the greater burden, then that makes sense: believers are actually
in a better position to make the translation.
One might object that the second point presupposes an asymmetry
between public secular reasons, to which both sides have access in
principle, and religious reasons, to which only believers have initial
and direct access. However, that objection supports Habermas's
position, and so leads into the third extension of his view. The
objection calls into question the assumption that everyone should in
principle have equal access to secular reason. Once we question that
assumption, it is unclear why secular reasons should have a privileged
place in political discourse. However, to reject the public position of
secular reasons, at least in a pluralistic polity, is to say there is
no public reason. Rather, each citizen's perspective, religious
or not, is comprehensive and somewhat opaque to others. In that case,
however, every citizen now faces burdens of translation that she can
shoulder only with the interlocutor's assistance. So the believer
is not relieved of translation. Instead, everyone is now burdened by
translation. To be sure, one might also remove the asymmetry between
access to secular and religious reason by making each sort of discourse
equally accessible to all in principle. But that view hardly does
justice to the existential import of religious experience, and so
should be rejected by believers.
