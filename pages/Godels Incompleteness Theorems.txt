Gödel’s incompleteness theorems are among the most
important results in modern logic. These discoveries revolutionized
the understanding of mathematics and logic, and had dramatic
implications for the philosophy of mathematics. There have also been
attempts to apply them in other fields of philosophy, but the
legitimacy of many such applications is much more controversial.
In order to understand Gödel’s theorems, one must first
explain the key concepts essential to it, such as “formal
system”, “consistency”, and
“completeness”. Roughly, a formal system is a
system of axioms equipped with rules of inference, which allow one to
generate new theorems. The set of axioms is required to be finite or
at least decidable, i.e., there must be an algorithm (an effective
method) which enables one to mechanically decide whether a given
statement is an axiom or not. If this condition is satisfied, the
theory is called “recursively axiomatizable”, or, simply,
“axiomatizable”. The rules of inference (of a formal
system) are also effective operations, such that it can always be
mechanically decided whether one has a legitimate application of a
rule of inference at hand. Consequently, it is also possible to decide
for any given finite sequence of formulas, whether it constitutes a
genuine derivation, or a proof, in the system—given the axioms
and the rules of inference of the system.
A formal system is complete if for every statement of the
language of the system, either the statement or its negation can be
derived (i.e., proved) in the system. A formal system is
consistent if there is no statement such that the statement
itself and its negation are both derivable in the system. Only
consistent systems are of any interest in this context, for it is an
elementary fact of logic that in an inconsistent formal system every
statement is derivable, and consequently, such a system is trivially
complete.
Gödel established two different though related incompleteness
theorems, usually called the first incompleteness theorem and the
second incompleteness theorem. “Gödel’s
theorem” is sometimes used to refer to the conjunction of these
two, but may refer to either—usually the first—separately.
Accommodating an improvement due to J. Barkley Rosser in 1936, the
first theorem can be stated, roughly, as follows:
First incompleteness theorem

Any consistent formal system \(F\) within which a certain amount of
elementary arithmetic can be carried out is incomplete; i.e., there
are statements of the language of \(F\) which can neither be proved
nor disproved in \(F\).
Gödel’s theorem does not merely claim that such statements
exist: the method of Gödel’s proof explicitly produces a
particular sentence that is neither provable nor refutable in
\(F\); the “undecidable” statement can be found
mechanically from a specification of \(F\). The sentence in
question is a relatively simple statement of number theory, a purely
universal arithmetical sentence.
A common misunderstanding is to interpret Gödel’s first
theorem as showing that there are truths that cannot be proved. This
is, however, incorrect, for the incompleteness theorem does not deal
with provability in any absolute sense, but only concerns derivability
in some particular formal system or another. For any statement
\(A\) unprovable in a particular formal system \(F\), there are,
trivially, other formal systems in which \(A\) is provable (take
\(A\) as an axiom). On the other hand, there is the extremely
powerful standard axiom system of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (denoted
as ZF, or, with the axiom of choice,
ZFC; see the section on the axioms of ZFC in the
entry on
 set theory),
 which is more than sufficient for the derivation of all ordinary
mathematics. Now there are, by Gödel’s first theorem,
arithmetical truths that are not provable even in
ZFC. Proving them would thus require a formal system
that incorporates methods going beyond ZFC. There is
thus a sense in which such truths are not provable using today’s
“ordinary” mathematical methods and axioms, nor can they
be proved in a way that mathematicians would today regard as
unproblematic and conclusive. 
Gödel’s second incompleteness theorem concerns the limits
of consistency proofs. A rough statement is:
Second incompleteness theorem

For any consistent system \(F\) within which a certain amount of
elementary arithmetic can be carried out, the consistency of \(F\)
cannot be proved in \(F\) itself.
In the case of the second theorem, \(F\) must contain a little bit
more arithmetic than in the case of the first theorem, which holds
under very weak conditions. It is important to note that this result,
like the first incompleteness theorem, is a theorem about formal
provability, or derivability (which is always relative to some formal
system; in this case, to \(F\) itself). It does not say anything
about whether, for a particular theory \(T\) satisfying the
conditions of the theorem, the statement “\(T\) is
consistent” can be proved in the sense of being shown to be true
by a conclusive argument, or by a proof generally acceptable for
mathematicians. For many theories, this is perfectly possible.
The existence of incomplete theories is hardly surprising. Take any
theory, even a complete one (see below for examples), and drop some
axiom; unless the axiom is redundant, the resulting system is
incomplete. The incompleteness theorems, however, deal with a much
more radical kind of incompleteness phenomenon. Unlike the above sort
of trivially incomplete theories, which can be easily completed, there
is no way of completing the relevant theories; all their extensions,
inasmuch as they are still formal systems and hence axiomatizable, are
also incomplete. They remain, so to speak, eternally incomplete and
can never be completed. They are “essentially incomplete”.
In the first and loose statements of the incompleteness theorems given
above, the vague requirement that “a certain amount of
elementary arithmetic can be carried out” occurred. It is time
to make this more precise.
The weakest standard system of arithmetic that is usually considered
in connection with incompleteness and undecidability is so-called
Robinson arithmetic (due to Raphael M. Robinson; see Tarski, Mostowski
and Robinson 1953), standardly denoted as Q. As
axioms, it has the following seven assumptions:
The intended interpretation of
“\(x'\)” is the successor
function, and obviously, of + and \(\times\), the addition and the
multiplication functions, respectively. “0” is the only
constant and denotes the number zero.
Adding to these elementary axioms the axiom scheme of induction:
results in (first order) Peano Arithmetic (PA). Note
that unlike Q, PA contains
infinitely many axioms, because all (infinitely many) instances of the
induction scheme, one corresponding to every formula \(\phi(x)\)
(with at least one free variable) of the language, are taken as
axioms. But it is a routine mechanical task to check whether a given
sentence is an instance of this scheme. PA is
generally taken as the standard first-order system of arithmetic.
Another natural and much-studied arithmetical system, which lies
between Q and PA in strength, is
Primitive Recursive Arithmetic (PRA). It contains not
just the above axioms of Q governing successor,
addition and multiplication, but also defining axioms for all
primitive recursive functions (see the entry on
 recursive functions),
 and the application of the induction scheme is restricted to
quantifier-free formulas (i.e., \(\phi(x)\) is not allowed to
contain any (unbounded) quantifiers).
However, essentially the same system is obtained if one takes just the
axioms of Q and the induction scheme restricted to,
roughly, purely existential formulas (in technical terms,
 \(\Sigma^{0}_1\)-formulas;
see below) (this was
first showed by Parsons 1970). Moreover, \(\Sigma^{0}_1\)-induction
can be shown (Paris and Kirby 1978) to be equivalent to the induction
scheme restricted to (roughly) purely universal formulas \((\Pi^{0}_1\)-formulas).
PRA
can also be formulated as a “logic-free” equational
calculus. PRA, or something equivalent to it, is
sufficient for developing the theory of syntax for formalized
theories. It is often taken as the unproblematic background theory in
which various other systems, whose legitimacy may be more
controversial, are studied.
A much stronger system than PA, important in the
foundations of mathematics, which will be mentioned now and then
below, is second-order arithmetic PA\(^2\)
(also often denoted by Z\(_2\)). It is more
than sufficient for developing all ordinary analysis and algebra. Its
language is a two-sorted first-order language (see the entry on
 second-order and higher-order logic),
 i.e., it contains two sorts of variables, number variables
\(x_1,x_2,\ldots\) (or \(x, y, z, \ldots\)) and property variables \(X_1,
X_2,\ldots\) (or \(X, Y, Z,\ldots)\), where properties are extensionally conceived.
As axioms it includes, in addition to the basic axioms of
PA, all instances of the second-order comprehension
scheme:
where \(\phi(x)\) can be any formula of the language of
PA\(^2\) in which \(X\) doesn’t occur
free. (It should be mentioned that PA\(^2\) can
also be formulated by adding the primitive notion of 
set membership \((\in)\) to the language, regarding the variables
\(X, Y, Z,\ldots\), as explicitly ranging
over sets, and reformulating second-order comprehension as
\(\exists X\forall x[x \in X \leftrightarrow \phi(x)\)].)
PA\(^2\) is a very strong theory. Via the
method of interpretations (see below), one can show that it is
proof-theoretically as strong as the Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory
ZFC without the power-set axiom, call it
ZFC–Pow (whereas the standard, first-order
PA is similarly proof-theoretically equivalent to
ZFC without the axiom of infinity,
ZFC–Inf). (Cf. the section on the axioms of ZFC
in the entry on
 set theory.)
Obviously, it is assumed that our formal systems are also equipped
with a system of rules of inferences (and possibly some logical
axioms), usually some standard system of classical logic (though the
incompleteness theorems do not essentially presuppose classical logic,
but also apply to systems with, e.g., intuitionistic logic). The above
standard systems all come with classical logic. The standard notation
\(F \vdash A\) is used to express (in the meta-level) that
\(A\) is derivable in \(F\), that is, that there is a proof of
\(A\) in \(F\), or, in other words, that \(A\) is a
theorem of \(F\). Accordingly, \(F \not\vdash A\)
means that \(A\) is not derivable in \(F\).
To summarize: when it is said, in the context of the incompleteness
theorems, that “a certain amount of elementary arithmetic can be
carried out” in a system, this usually means that it contains
PRA or at least Q. For the first
incompleteness theorem, Q is sufficient; for the
standard proofs of the second theorem, something like
PRA, at a minimum, is needed. There is a version of
the second incompleteness theorem for Q (see
Bezboruah & Shepherdson 1976) but there has been some debate on
whether the relevant statement in Q can really be
taken to express consistency, Q being so weak (see
Kreisel 1958; Bezboruah & Shepherdson 1976; Pudlák 1996;
Franks 2009).
Of course, there are many important and interesting theories in
mathematics which are not even formulated in the language of
arithmetic. However, the applicability of the incompleteness theorems
can be dramatically extended outside the language of first-order
arithmetic and its extensions, when it is noted that all that is
needed is that weak theories such as Q, or
PRA, can be interpreted in the system in
question. Most importantly, this involves various systems of set
theory. For example, the incompleteness theorems hold for
ZFC–Inf (i.e., ZFC without the
axiom of infinity) and all its extensions, however strong (as long as
they are axiomatizable.)
Roughly, a theory \(T_1\) is interpretable in another
theory \(T_2\) if the primitive concepts and the range of
the variables of \(T_1\) are definable in
\(T_2\) so that it is possible to translate every theorem
of \(T_1\) into a theorem of \(T_2\). One
should not misunderstand such interpretations as providing anything
like intuitive synonymity. Two theories may have radically different
intended subject matter and yet, as formal systems, one may be
interpretable in another. (As an illustration: a simple theory of
ancestors may be, taken as a formal system, interpreted in arithmetic;
obviously this does not mean that grandmothers and such are really
numbers.) What is significant is that interpretability preserves
certain elementary formal properties of theories, most
importantly, consistency: if \(T_1\) is interpretable in
\(T_2\) and \(T_2\) is consistent,
\(T_1\) is also consistent. And any system in which
Q can be interpreted is guaranteed to be essentially
incomplete. For any such theory in which Q is
interpretable, the incompleteness could be proved also directly; for
example, in various theories of set theory, one can code formulas and
derivations (instead of numbers) by sets, “Gödel
sets”, and proceed then as usual (see, e.g., Fitting 2007).
However, for most purposes, it is just much simpler to establish the
interpretability of Q in the theory at issue.
In sum, when it is said that “a certain amount of elementary
arithmetic can be carried out within a system”, what is meant is
either that the system is an axiomatizable extension of
Q, or that Q can be interpreted in
it. (In the case of (the standard proofs of) the second incompleteness
theorem, substitute PRA for Q.)
On the other hand, not all theories of arithmetic are incomplete. The
theory of only addition of natural numbers but without multiplication
(often called “Presburger arithmetic”), for example, is
complete (and decidable) (Presburger 1929), as is the theory of
multiplication of the positive integers (Skolem 1930). These theories
are, though, very weak. But in any case, at least a theory which deals
with both addition and multiplication is needed. More interestingly,
the natural first-order theory of arithmetic of real numbers
(with both addition and multiplication), the so-called theory of real
closed fields \((\mathbf{RCF})\), is both complete and decidable,
as was shown by Tarski (1948); he also demonstrated that the
first-order theory of Euclidean geometry is complete and decidable.
Thus, one should keep in mind that there are some non-trivial and
interesting theories to which Gödel’s theorems do not
apply.
Gödel originally only established the incompleteness of a
particular though very comprehensive formalized theory
P, a variant of Russell’s type-theoretical
system PM (for Principia Mathematica, see the
sections on Paradoxes and Russell’s Type Theories in the entries
on
 type theory
 and
 Principia Mathematica),
 and all extension of P with the same language, whose
set of axioms is primitive recursive. He also suggested, though did
not demonstrate, that the proof could be adapted to apply also to the
standard axiom systems of set theory such as ZFC.
Though it turns out that Gödel in fact already had a very general
result, it was, at the time, unclear just how general this really was
(see also
 Section 5).
What was still missing was an analysis of the intuitive notion of
decidability, needed in the characterization of the notion of an
arbitrary formal system. Recall that the set of axioms and the proof
relation of a formalized system are required to be decidable.
Mathematicians and logicians have implicitly used the intuitive notion
of a decision method since antiquity, and as long as one asked for a
positive solution, it was sufficient that one presented a concrete
method that intuitively striked everyone as a mechanical method. For
the general limitative results, such as the general incompleteness
theorems, or the undecidability results (see
 4.2),
 however, a precise mathematical explication of the notion would be
needed. Instead of decidable sets or properties, one often considers
effective or computable functions or operations, but in fact these are
just two sides of the same coin—talk of one can be easily
transcribed to talk of another.
Gödel (1934), Alonzo Church (1936a, b) and Alan Turing
(1936–7) came up independently with different proposals for an
exact mathematical definition of computable functions, and
consequently, of decidable sets (of numbers). These proposals, though,
all turned out to be equivalent. Turing’s careful conceptual
analysis which used fictional and abstract computing machines
(nowadays conventionally called “Turing machines”; see the
entry on
 Turing machines)
 was particularly important, as Gödel himself emphasized (see,
e.g., Gödel 1963). The equation of the intuitive notion and some
of these mathematical explications is often called “The
Church-Turing-thesis”. The label “recursive
function” has, for historical reasons, been dominant in the
logical literature. Consequently, decidable sets are often called
“recursive sets”. (See the entries on
 computability,
 recursive functions and
 the Church-Turing thesis.)
For a proper understanding of the incompleteness and undecidability
results, it is vital to understand the difference between the two key
notions regarding sets. First, there may be a mechanical method which
decides whether any given number belongs to the set at issue or not
(in which case the set is called “decidable” or
“recursive”), and, second, there may be a mechanical
method which generates or lists the elements of the set, number by
number. In the latter case, the set is called “recursively
enumerable” (r.e.), that is to say, it can be effectively
generated, or it is “semi-decidable.” It is a fundamental
result of the theory of computability (or “the theory of
recursive functions”) that there are semi-decidable sets, sets
which can be effectively generated (i.e., are recursively enumerable),
but are not decidable (i.e., not recursive). In fact, this is,
in the very abstract level, the essence of the first incompleteness
theorem. However, if both a set and its complement are recursively
enumerable, the set is recursive, i.e., decidable.
In this section, the main lines of the proof of the first
incompleteness theorem are sketched. A reader interested in more
details can consult the Supplements
 (Gödel Numbering
 and
 The Diagonalization Lemma).
The formal term (“numeral”) canonically denoting the
natural number \(\boldsymbol{n}\) is abbreviated as
\(\underline{n}\). In the standard language of arithmetic used here,
the number \(\boldsymbol{n}\) is denoted by the term
\(0^{\prime\cdots\prime}\), where the successor symbol
‘\('\)’ is iterated \(n\) times. That is, numerals which
name 1, 2, 3, … are \(0', 0'', 0''',\ldots\) and are
abbreviated by 1, 2, 3, …
In his original proof, Gödel used his specific notion of
\(\omega\)-consistency, and for some purposes, it is still convenient to
follow Gödel’s original approach. A formalized theory
\(F\) is \(\omega\)-consistent if it is not the case
that for some formula \(A(x)\), both \(F \vdash \neg A(\underline{n})\) for all 
\(\mathbf{n}\), and
\(F \vdash \exists xA(x)\). Naturally this implies
normal consistency, and follows from the assumption that the natural
numbers satisfy the axioms of \(F\).
Actually, a simple special case of \(\omega\)-consistency suffices
here; namely, the assumption is only needed with respect to what
logicians call \(\Sigma^{0}_1\)-formulas;
these are, roughly, the
purely existential formulas; more exactly, formulas of the form
\(\exists x_1\exists x_2 \ldots \exists x_n A\),
where \(A\) does not contain any unbounded quantifiers \((A\)
may contain bounded universal quantifiers \(\forall x \lt t\) and bounded
existential quantifiers \(\exists x \lt t)\). This restricted \(\omega\)-consistency is called
1-consistency.
\(\omega\)-consistency and 1-consistency are purely syntactic
notions. If the use of the notions of truth and falsity is allowed,
the assumption of 1-consistency can be expressed intuitively simply as
the requirement that the formal system in question does not prove any
false \(\Sigma^{0}_1\)-sentences
(i.e., the system is
sound at least in the case of such sentences). From now on, it
is assumed that the formalized systems under consideration contain
Q and are assumed to be at least 1-consistent, unless
otherwise stated. 
Gödel’s proof also requires the notion of representability
of sets and relations in a formal system \(F\). More precisely, two
related notion are needed.
A set \(S\) of natural numbers is strongly
representable in \(F\) if there is a formula
\(A(x)\) of the language of \(F\) with one free variable
\(x\) such that for every natural number
\(\boldsymbol{n}\):
A set \(S\) of natural numbers is weakly
representable in \(F\) if there is a formula
\(A(x)\) of the language of \(F\) such that for every
natural number \(\boldsymbol{n}\):
It is obvious how all these notions are generalized to many-place
relations. There are also related notions of representability for
functions. As the incompleteness results in particular teach us, there
are sets which are only weakly but not strongly representable (the key
example being the set of statements provable in the system).
[Warning: Here the terminology in the literature
varies a lot: “strongly represent” is sometimes called,
e.g., “represent”, “numeralwise express”,
“bi-numerate”, “define” or “strongly
define”; “weakly represent” is in turn also
expressed, e.g., by “represent”, “define”,
“weakly define”, or “numerate”. One should be
careful here and focus on the relevant definitions, and not let the
words mislead.]
In the case of both kinds of representability (weak and strong), there
is always a simple existential \(\Sigma^{0}_1\)-formula,
which (weakly or strongly) represents the set in question, and usually
such a formula is used to represent \(S\).
Though these notions are relative to the formal system, it has turned
out that strong and weak representability are extremely stable. Quite
independently of the particular formal system chosen, exactly the
decidable, or recursive, sets (relations) are strongly representable,
and exactly the semi-decidable, or recursively enumerable sets
(relations) are weakly representable. This holds for all formalized
systems which contain Robinson arithmetic Q, from
Robinson arithmetic itself to the strongest axioms systems of set
theory like ZFC and beyond (as long as they are
(recursively) axiomatizable). Instead of using the notion of
“representability”, Gödel took a different approach
by speaking of sets being “decidable in a formal system
\(F\)” (“entscheidungsdefinit”). If the
proofs of \(F\) are systematically generated, it will be eventually
determined, for any given number \(\boldsymbol{n}\), whether it
belongs to \(S\) or not—given that \(S\) is strongly
representable in \(F\). 
In sum, we have:
Both notions of representability—strong and weak—must be
clearly distinguished from mere definability (in the standard
sense of the word). A set \(S\) is definable in the language
of arithmetic if there is a formula \(A(x)\) in the language
such that \(A(\underline{n})\) is true in the standard structure
of natural numbers (the intended interpretation) if and only if
\(\boldsymbol{n} \in S.\) There are many sets which
can be defined in the language of arithmetic but not (even weakly)
represented in any \(F\), such as the set of consistent formulas,
the set of sentences unprovable in the system \(F\), or the set of
Diophantine equations with no solutions (see below).
The next essential step of Gödel’s proof is to take the
language of a formal system, which is always precisely defined (this
is part of being a formal system), and fix a correspondence of a
certain kind between the expressions of that language and the system
of natural numbers—a coding, “arithmetization”, or
“Gödel numbering”, of the language. There are many
possible ways of accomplishing this, and the details do not really
matter (for some more details of one quite standard approach, see the
supplementary document
 Gödel Numbering).
 The essential point is that the chosen mapping is effective: it is
always possible to pass, purely mechanically, from an expression to
its code number, and from a number to the corresponding expression.
Today, when most of us are familiar with computers and the fact that
so many things can be coded by zeros and ones, the possibility of such
an arithmetization is hardly surprising.
Roughly, one proceeds as follows: First, the primitive symbols of the
language are paired with distinct natural numbers, “symbol
numbers”. A little number theory then suffices to code
sequences of numbers by single numbers. Consequently,
well-formed formulas, as sequences of primitive symbols, are each
assigned a unique number. Finally derivations, or proofs, of the
system, being sequences of formulas, are arithmetized, and are also
assigned specific numbers. Such a code, the “Gödel
number” of a formula \(A\), is denoted as
\(\ulcorner A\urcorner\), and similarly for
derivations.
In this way, syntactical properties, relations and operations are
reflected in arithmetic: for example, \(\textit{neg}(x)\) is the
arithmetical function that sends the Gödel number of a formula to
the Gödel number of its negation; in other words,
\(\textit{neg}(\ulcorner A\urcorner) = (\ulcorner \neg A\urcorner)\);
similarly, \(\impl(x, y)\) is the function which maps the Gödel
numbers of a pair of formulas to the Gödel number of the
implication of the formulas: \(\impl(\ulcorner A\urcorner ,\ulcorner
B\urcorner) = \ulcorner A \rightarrow B\urcorner\); and so on. There
is an arithmetical formula, call it
\(\textit{Fmla}(x)\), which is true of \(\boldsymbol{n}\) iff
\(\boldsymbol{n}\) is a Gödel number of a well-formed formula of
the system. There is also an arithmetical formula \(M(x,y,z)\) which
is true exactly if one has a valid application of the rule of
inference modus ponens for some formulas \(A\) and \(B\)
with \(x = \ulcorner A\urcorner\), \(y = \ulcorner A \rightarrow
B\urcorner\) and \(z = \ulcorner B\urcorner\); etc. In this way, all
the syntactic properties and operations can be simulated at the level
of numbers, and moreover they are strongly representable in all
theories which contain
Q.
As it is decidable (by the definition of formal systems) whether a
given sequence of formulas constitutes a proof of a given sentence,
according to the rules of the chosen formal system \(F\), the binary
relation “\(x\) is (the Gödel number of) a proof of the
formula (with the Gödel number) \(y\)” can be strongly
represented in all systems containing Q, and thus in \(F\) in
particular. Let us denote the formula which strongly represents this
relation in \(F\) itself as \(\Prf_F (x, y)\).  The property of being
provable in \(F\) can then be defined as \(\exists x\Prf_F (x,
y)\). Let us abbreviate this formalized provability predicate
as \(\Prov_F (x)\).  It follows that
the latter is weakly representable (though, it turns out, not
strongly):
It is always possible to choose the provability predicate
\(\Prov_F (x)\) to be a \(\Sigma^{0}_1\)-formula.
The next and perhaps somewhat surprising ingredient of
Gödel’s proof is the following important lemma (we still
assume that \(F\) is a formal system which contains
Q):
Let \(A(x)\) be an arbitrary formula of the language of
\(F\) with only one free variable. Then a sentence \(D\) can be
mechanically constructed such that
(For a sketch of the proof; see Supplement: The
Diagonalization Lemma)
In the literature, this lemma is sometimes also called “the
self-referential lemma” or “the fixed point lemma”.
It has many important applications beyond the incompleteness
theorems.
It is often said that given a property denoted by \(A(x)\),
the sentence \(D\) is a self-referential sentence which “says
of itself” that it has the property \(A\). Such figures of
speech may be heuristically useful, but they are also easily
misleading and suggest too much. For example, note that the lemma only
provides a (provable) material equivalence between \(D\) and
\(A(\ulcorner D\urcorner)\) (which states
that both sides must have the same truth-value) and does not claim any
sort of sameness of meaning. In particular, \(D\) and
\(A(\ulcorner D\urcorner)\) are by no means
identical—and neither are
\(\ulcorner D\urcorner\) and
\(\ulcorner A(\ulcorner D\urcorner)\urcorner\).
To complete the proof, the Diagonalization Lemma is applied to the
negated provability predicate
\(\neg\Prov_F (x)\): this gives a sentence
\(G_F\) such that
Thus, it can be shown, even inside \(F\), that \(G_F\) is true if and
only if it is not provable in \(F\).
It is not difficult to show that \(G_F\) is neither provable nor
disprovable in \(F\), if \(F\) only is 1-consistent. 
For the first half, assume that \(G_F\) were provable. Then, by the
weak representability of provability-in-\(F\) by
\(\Prov_F(x)\), \(F\) would also prove \(\Prov_F (\ulcorner
G_F\urcorner)\).  However, because \(F\) in fact also proves the
equivalence (G), i.e, \(F \vdash G_F \leftrightarrow \neg\Prov_F
(\ulcorner G_F\urcorner)\), \(F\) would then prove \(\neg G_F\)
too. But this would mean that \(F\) is inconsistent. In sum, if \(F\)
is consistent, then \(G_F\) is not provable in \(F\). For this first
half, the assumption of the simple consistency of \(F\) suffices.
For the second half, it has to be assumed that \(F\) is 1-consistent
(if \(\Prov_F (\ulcorner G_F\urcorner)\) has been chosen such that it
is a \(\Sigma^{0}_1\)-sentence; otherwise, the more general assumption
of \(\omega\)-consistency is needed).
Assume that \(F \vdash \neg G_F\). Then \(F\) cannot prove \(G_F\),
for otherwise \(F\) would be simply inconsistent. Hence no natural
number \(\boldsymbol{n}\) is the Gödel number of a proof of
\(G_F\), and because the proof relation is strongly representable, for
all \(\boldsymbol{n}\), \(F \vdash \neg\Prf_F (\underline{n},
\ulcorner G_F\urcorner)\).  If also \(F \vdash \exists x\Prf_F (x,
\ulcorner G_F\urcorner)\), \(F\) is not 1-consistent, against the
assumption. Therefore \(F\) does not prove \(\exists
x\Prf_F (x, \ulcorner G_F\urcorner)\), in other words, by the
definition of \(\Prov_F (x), F\) does not prove \(\Prov_F (\ulcorner
G_F\urcorner)\).  By the key equivalence (G), \(F\) also does not
prove \(\neg G_F\).
Assume \(F\) is a formalized system which contains Robinson
arithmetic Q. Then a sentence \(G_F\) of the language of \(F\)
can be mechanically constructed from \(F\) such that:
Such an independent, or “undecidable” (that is, neither
provable nor refutable in \(F)\) statement \(G_F\) in \(F\) is often
called “the Gödel sentence” of \(F\).
In fact, in favourable circumstances, it can be shown that \(G_F\) is
true, provided that \(F\) is indeed consistent. This is the case if,
for example, the provability predicate \(\Prov_F (x)\) has been chosen
as a \(\Sigma^{0}_1\)-formula: The Gödel sentence is then
provably equivalent to the universal formula \(\forall x\neg\Prf_F (x,
\ulcorner G_F\urcorner)\).  Such formulas can be proved false whenever
they in fact are false: if false, there would be a number
\(\boldsymbol{n}\) such that \(F \vdash\Prf_F (\underline{n},
\ulcorner G_F\urcorner)\) (this holds already in Q). This,
however, would contradict the incompleteness theorem. Therefore,
\(G_F\) cannot be false, and must be true. For this reason, the
Gödel sentence is often called “true but
unprovable”.
One should not get confused here: “Gödel’s
theorem” is the general incompleteness result of Gödel
which concerns a large class of formal systems, while the
“Gödel sentence” is the constructed, formally
undecidable sentence which varies from one formal system to another.
This is why it is important to include the subscript \(F\) in
\(G_F\). Furthermore, one should not confuse the
two different senses of “undecidable” in this context. On
the one hand, a particular sentence, like the Gödel
sentence, may be undecidable in the sense of being independent, i.e.,
neither provable not refutable in a chosen system. On the other hand,
a theory may be undecidable (see below) in the sense that there
does not exist a decision method for determining of an arbitrary given
sentence of the language whether or not it is derivable in the theory
(so this latter sense of “undecidable” concerns, so to
speak, an infinite class of statements).
In informal explanations of the first incompleteness theorem, it is
often said that the Gödel sentence \(G_F\)
“says of itself that it is not provable”. Such imprecise
statements, however, should be taken at least with a grain of salt.
There are a number of reasons to conclude that, at least in general,
Gödel sentences do not really say anything substantial about
themselves (Milne 2007 is a careful analysis of such issues); for
example, as was previously noted in the case of the Diagonalization
Lemma, one is usually operating here with mere material
equivalences.
In 1936, J. Barkley Rosser made an important improvement that allows
one to get rid of the somewhat clumsy assumption of
\(\omega\)-consistency in the proof of Gödel’s
first theorem. For this purpose, Rosser introduced a new,
somewhat artificial “provability predicate”
\(\Prov^*(x)\) which was constructed, informally, as
follows:
There exists \(y\) such that \(y\) is the Gödel number of a
proof of the formula with Gödel number \(x\), AND there
does not exist \(z\) smaller than \(y\) such that \(z\) is the
Gödel number of a proof the negation of the formula with
Gödel number \(x\).
More formally:
where \(\Prf_F (y, x)\) is the more
standard proof relation discussed earlier.
As it happens, if the formal system \(F\) under consideration is
indeed consistent, Rosser’s provability predicate is
co-extensional with the ordinary provability predicate. Applying the
Diagonalization Lemma to the negation of Rosser’s provability
predicate \(\Prov^*(x)\) gives:
Rosser’s modification of the first theorem (Rosser
1936)

Let \(F\) be consistent formalized system which contains
Q. Then there is a sentence \(R_F\) of the language of \(F\)
such that neither \(R_F\) nor \(\neg R_F\) is provable in \(F\).
It is illuminating to reflect on the first incompleteness theorem also
from the model theoretic perspective—though the theorem itself
does not in any way require this. Namely, it is possible to conclude
that any theory \(F\) satisfying the conditions of the theorem must
possess, in addition to the intended interpretation or “standard
model” (in the case of arithmetical theories, the structure of
natural numbers), non-intended interpretations or “non-standard
models”—that no such theory can rule out the latter and
fix uniquely the intended interpretation. Namely, if there are
independent statements such as \(G_F, F\)
must have both models which satisfy \(G_F\) and
models which rather satisfy \(\neg G_F\). As
\(\neg G_F\) is equivalent to 
\(\exists x\Prf_F (x, \ulcorner G_F\urcorner)\),
the latter models must possess entities which satisfy the formula
\(\Prf_F (x, \ulcorner G_F\urcorner)\).
And yet we know (because \(\Prf_F (x, y)\)
strongly represents the proof relation) that for any numeral
\(\underline{n}, F\) can prove
\(\neg\Prf_F (\underline{n}, \ulcorner G_F\urcorner)\).
Therefore, no natural number \(\boldsymbol{n}\) can witness the
formula. It follows that any such non-standard model must contain, in
addition to natural numbers (denotations of the numerals
\(\underline{n})\), “infinite” non-natural numbers after the
natural numbers.
The study of non-standard models did not start with Gödel’s
results—Skolem, in particular, was already aware of them earlier
in a different context (he had discovered that first-order theories of
set theory have unnaturally small, namely, countable models, in Skolem
1922; cf. the entry on
 Skolem’s paradox)—but
 the first incompleteness theorem elucidates the existence of
non-standard models in the context of arithmetic, while the
nonstandard models elucidate the first incompleteness theorem.
Non-standard models have since then become a rich research area in
mathematical logic (see, e.g., Boolos & Jeffrey 1989: Ch. 17; Kaye
1991).
Informally, the reasoning leading to the second incompleteness theorem
is relatively simple. Given the arithmetized provability predicate, it
is also easy to present an arithmetized consistency statement: pick
some manifestly inconsistent formula (in arithmetical theories, a
standard choice is \((\underline{0} = \underline{1})\)); let
us denote it by \(\bot\); (the arithmetized counterpart of) the
consistency of the system can then be defined as
\(\neg\Prov_F (\ulcorner \bot \urcorner)\).
Let us abbreviate this formula by \(\Cons(F)\). The proof of
the first part of the first incompleteness theorem (i.e., the case (i)
above) can then presumably be formalized inside \(F\) (in practice
this would certainly be intricate). This gives:
where \(G_F\) is the Gödel sentence for
\(F\) provided by the first theorem. If \(\Cons(F)\) were
provable in \(F\), so would be \(G_F\), by
simple logic. This would contradict Gödel’s first theorem.
Consequently, \(\Cons(F)\) cannot be provable in \(F\)
either.
Gödel’s second incompleteness theorem

Assume \(F\) is a consistent formalized system which contains
elementary arithmetic. Then \(F \not\vdash\Cons(F)\).
There is a question of philosophical importance that should be
mentioned here: As it stands, Gödel’s second incompleteness
theorem only establishes the unprovability of one sentence,
\(\Cons(F)\). But does this sentence really express that
\(F\) is consistent? (Compare this with the remark above that
\(G_F\) does not, strictly speaking, express its
own unprovability.) Furthermore, might there not be other
sentences which are provable and also express the consistency of
\(F\)?
Giving a rigorous proof of the second theorem in a more general form
that covers all such sentences, however, has turned out to be very
complicated. The basic reason for this is that, unlike in the first
theorem, not just any, merely extensionally adequate provability
predicate works for the formalization of the consistency claim. The
manner of presentation makes all the difference. For example,
Rosser’s provability predicate mentioned above would not do; one
can prove the “consistency” of \(F\) in \(F\), if
consistency is expressed in terms of Rosser’s provability
predicate. One must thus add some further conditions for the
provability predicate in order for the proof of the second
incompleteness theorem to go through. Following Feferman (1960), it is
customary to say that whereas the first theorem and its relatives are
extensional results, the second theorem is intensional:
it must be possible to think that \(\Cons(F)\) in some sense
expresses the consistency of \(F\)—that it really
means that \(F\) is consistent.
The proof of the second incompleteness theorem requires that the
provability predicate in \(F\) satisfies a number of conditions
which are used in the details of the proof. There are several
different sets of conditions that will do.
The first detailed proof of the second incompleteness theorem appeared
in (Hilbert & Bernays 1939) (mainly written by Bernays), though
only for one specific theory, PA. It uses a rather
awkward set of conditions for the provability predicate. These were
more technical lemmas for the needs of a particular proof and not any
sort of analysis of “natural” provability predicates. A
much more elegant, now standard list of “derivability
conditions” was presented by Löb (1955)—though their
intended use was somewhat different (see below).
(D1) is simply a restatement of the requirement from the proof of the
first theorem that provability is weakly representable. Roughly put,
(D2) requires that the whole demonstration of (D1), for the candidate
provability predicate \(\Prov_F\), can itself be
formalized inside \(F\). Finally, (D3) requires that the
provability predicate is closed under Modus Ponens.
If the arithmetized provability predicate indeed satisfies these
conditions, the second theorem can be proved. Let
\(G_F\) once again be the Gödel sentence for
\(F\) given by the first theorem. It is not too difficult to show,
using the derivability conditions, that:
This immediately yields the unprovability of \(\Cons(F)\),
given the first incompleteness theorem. 
Furthermore, Jeroslow (1973) demonstrated, with an ingenious trick,
that it is in fact possible to establish the second theorem without
(D3). However, in some other cases (e.g., when proving
Löb’s theorem; see below), and in Provability Logic, all
three conditions are still needed.
Under the assumption that a provability predicate for a theory
satisfies the derivability conditions (or, by Jeroslow’s trick,
at least D1 and D2) it is relatively easy to prove the relevant case
of the second incompleteness theorem. However, in practise one has to
establish whether a proposed arithmetized provability predicate really
satisfies the conditions case by case, and typically this is long and
tedious.
This drawback, among other things (see Feferman 1997), led Solomon
Feferman in the late 1950s to look for an alternative line of attack
to the second theorem (see Feferman 1960). Feferman approaches the
issue in two steps: First, he isolates the formulas
\(\Prov_{FOL}(x)\) which arithmetize some standard
notion of derivability in first-order logic in order to allow
us to fix one chosen formula for provability in logic. How the set of
non-logical axioms of the system at issue are presented is left open
at this stage. Secondly, Feferman looks for a suitable constraint for
presenting the axioms. Among the formulas of the language of
arithmetic, he isolates what he calls PR- and RE-formulas; the former
correspond to the canonical primitive recursive (PR) definitions in
arithmetic, and the latter to existential generalizations of the
former. Every recursively enumerable (RE) set can be defined by a
formula of the latter sort; these are just the \(\Sigma^{0}_1\)-formulas.
These two classes are
easy to discriminate purely by their syntactical form. (In fact, by
the MRDP Theorem (see below), one could—instead of
RE-formulas—focus on even simpler class of existentially
quantified Diophantine equations.)
We have above noted the important fact that in all arithmetical
theories \(F\) containing Q, a set is strongly
representable in \(F\) if and only if it is recursive, and a set is
recursively enumerable if and only if it is weakly representable.
Furthermore, one can always take the formula weakly or strongly
representing the set to be a RE-formula (i.e., \(\Sigma^{0}_1\)-formula;
and, by MRDP Theorem,
even an existentially quantified Diophantine equation). It is then
natural to require that the set of non-logical axioms of the system at
issue is represented by such a formula. If the arithmetized definition
of the set of Gödel numbers of axioms reflects how the axioms, if
infinite, are inductively defined, the resulting formula will be \(\Sigma^{0}_1\).
(For theories which are
axiomatizable with finitely many axioms, there is a unique
representation of the axioms in the form of a list, and consequently,
a unique consistency statement relative to
\(\Prov_{FOL}(x)\).) In contrast to determining
whether the derivability conditions are satisfied, it is a relatively
routine task to determine that a given formula which formalizes the
axioms is indeed of the required form (\(\Sigma^{0}_1\)).
Now the version of the second incompleteness theorem presented in
Feferman 1960 is:
A variant of second incompleteness theorem (Feferman 1960)
 
Let \(F\) be a consistent extension of PA, and let \(Ax_F (x)\)
be a \(\Sigma^{0}_1\)-formula which weakly represents the axioms of
\(F\), and \(\Cons(F)\) be a consistency statement constructed from
\(Ax_F (x)\) and \(\Prov_{FOL}(x)\). Then \(\Cons(F)\) is not provable
in \(F\).
For still different approaches to the second incompleteness theorem,
see Feferman 1982, 1989a; Visser 2011. For some philosophical
complications concerning the second theorem, see Detlefsen 1979, 1986,
1990, 2001; Auerbach 1985, 1992; Roeper 2003; Franks 2009 (see also
section on incompleteness in the entry on
 Hilbert’s program).
Gödel first arrived at the incompleteness results (see
 Section 5
 below) by noting that truth (of the language of a system) must be
undefinable in the system, a result conventionally credited to Tarski
(there are certain real virtues in Tarski’s way of presenting
the issue; see Gómez Torrente 2004). Let us now view the result
in the context of Tarski’s approach to truth.
Tarski clearly distinguished the object language, i.e., the language
the truth of whose sentences is at stake, and the metalanguage in
which the former is discussed. He also required (see the entry on
 Tarski’s truth definitions)
 that any satisfactory definition of truth \(\True(x)\) for
the object language should satisfy his “Convention T”,
that is, it should have as its consequence all equivalences
(“T-equivalences”) of the form
where \(\ulcorner A\urcorner\) is a name of a
sentence of the object language, and \(B\) its translation in the
metalanguage. If the metalanguage is identical with the object
language, or is an extension of the object language, \(B\) is
simply \(A\) itself, and the T-equivalences are of the form:
What the undefinability theorem shows is that the object language and
the metalanguage cannot coincide, but must be distinct.
Tarski’s Undefinability Theorem

Let \(F\) be a consistent formalized system that contains a sufficient
amount of arithmetic. Then there is no formula \(Tr(x)\) in the
language of \(F\) such that for every sentence \(A\) of the language
of \(F\):
The idea of the proof: If there were such a formula
of the language of \(F\), an easy application of the Diagonalization
Lemma to its negation would result in the paradoxical sentence \(L\)
(for “Liar”; see the Liar paradox)), such that:
which, together with the T-equivalences, which were assumed to be
derivable, would quickly give an explicit contradiction, thus
contradicting the assumption that \(F\) is consistent.
Similarly, it can be proved that the set of true sentences of \(F\)
is not definable in the intended interpretation of \(F\)—in
the now standard sense of “definability” (see above). 
The tools used in proving Gödel’s theorems also provide
various important undecidability results. A theory is called
decidable if the set of its theorems (sentences derivable in
it) is decidable, that is (by the Church-Turing thesis) recursive.
Otherwise, the theory is undecidable. Informally, being decidable
means that there is a mechanical procedure which enables one to decide
whether an arbitrary given sentence (of the language of the theory) is
a theorem or not.
If a theory is complete, it is decidable (proof sketch: given a
sentence \(A\), systematically generate the theorems of the theory;
by completeness, eventually either \(A\) or \(\neg A\) will be
produced in a finite time). The converse, though, does not always
hold: there are incomplete theories which are decidable. Nevertheless,
incompleteness at least opens the possibility of undecidability.
Moreover, all theories which contain Robinson arithmetic
Q (either directly, or Q can be
interpreted in them) are both incomplete and undecidable. Thus, for a
very wide class of theories, incompleteness and undecidability go hand
in hand.
One elegant and simple way of demonstrating the undecidability of
extensions of Q goes, roughly, as follows: Let \(F\) be any
consistent theory that contains Q.  Assume then that the set of
its theorems is decidable, that is (by the Church-Turing thesis),
recursive. It would then follow that the set (of the Gödel
numbers) of the theorems of \(F\) is strongly representable
in \(F\) itself. Recall that this means that there is some formula
\(B(x)\) of the language of \(F\) such that not only \(F \vdash
B(\ulcorner A\urcorner)\) whenever \(F \vdash A\) (which even weak
representability guarantees), but also that \(F \vdash \neg
B(\ulcorner A\urcorner)\) whenever \(F \not\vdash A\). However, the
technique used in the proof of the first incompleteness theorem also
shows that there are always sentences for which the latter does not
hold: it is possible to construct a Gödel sentence \(G^B\)
relative to \(B(x)\) for \(F\) such that:
As before, it follows that \(F \not\vdash G^B\). It
has been assumed that \(B(x)\) strongly represents the set
of theorems, so this entails \(F \vdash \neg B(\ulcorner G^B \urcorner)\),
and therefore, by (D), \(F \vdash G^B\), a contradiction. Therefore, \(F\) must
be undecidable. 
A theory \(F\) is called essentially undecidable if every
consistent extension of it in the language of \(F\) is undecidable.
The above proof sketch in fact establishes that Q is
essentially undecidable. (There are some very weak theories that are
undecidable but not essentially undecidable.)
Recall that Q has only finitely many axioms and let
\(A_Q\) stand for the single sentence consisting
of the conjunction of the axioms of Q. Then for any
sentence \(B\) of the language of arithmetic,
\(\mathbf{Q} \vdash B\) if and only if it is a theorem
of first-order logic that \(A_Q \rightarrow B\).
But then a decision procedure for first-order logic would provide a
decision method for Q. The latter, however, is
impossible, as it has already been shown. Therefore, it can be
concluded:
Church’s Theorem

First-order predicate logic is undecidable.
(This undecidability result was first established by Church 1936a, b;
the method of deriving it via the undecidability of Q
is due to Tarski, Mostowski and Robinson 1953.)
Subsequently, a number of theories and problems from different areas
of mathematics have been shown to be undedicable (see, e.g., Davis
1977; Murawski 1999: Ch 3).
Heuristically, one may view the Gödel sentence
\(G_F\) as expressing its own
unprovability—saying “I am not
provable”—though, as was already emphasized, such claims
should be taken with a grain of salt. Leon Henkin put forward the
question whether the sentence expressing its own provability
(“I am provable”) is true or false, and provable or not
(Henkin 1952). Georg Kreisel soon pointed out that this depends
vitally on how provability is expressed; with different choices, one
gets opposite answers (Kreisel 1953). 
The paper of Martin Hugo Löb (1955), augmented by comments of a
referee, brought substantial advances on various fronts. First, it
introduces the now standard Löb derivability conditions discussed
previously in the context of the second incompleteness theorem.
Second, it contains Löb’s solution of Henkin’s
problem about sentences “expressing their own
provability”. Third, it contains a generalization now called
“Löb’s Theorem”, but which Löb actually
credits to the anonymous referee (who happened to be none other than
Henkin himself; the whole story is told in Smoryński 1991.)
In order to understand Löb’s theorem properly it is useful
to first consider the so-called “reflection principles”.
Above, the focus has been on expressing, inside a formal system, that
the system is consistent, i.e., on \(\Cons(F)\). But
naturally the theory should not merely be consistent but also
sound, i.e., prove only true sentences. How should the
soundness of a system, i.e., the claim that everything derivable in
the system is true, be expressed? If one wants to express this in the
language of the system itself, it cannot be done by a single statement
saying this, because there is, by the undefinability of truth, no
suitable truth predicate available in the language. Various restricted
and unrestricted soundness claims can, however, be expressed in the
form of a scheme, the so-called Reflection Principles:
By taking \(A\) to be \(\bot\), and noting that \(\bot\) is refutable
in \(F\), it is easy to see that Reflection Principle entails the
consistency statement Cons\((F)\), i.e., \(\neg\Prov_F (\ulcorner \bot
\urcorner)\); hence it cannot be generally provable in the system.
The scheme can also be restricted. Equivalent to the assumption of
1-consistency, or \(\Sigma^{0}_1\)-soundness, for example, is the
Reflection Principle restricted to \(\Sigma^{0}_1\)-sentences (i.e.,
the sentence \(A\) in the scheme is required to be a
\(\Sigma^{0}_1\)-sentence.)  Or, it can be restricted to the universal
\(\Pi^{0}_1\)-sentences; and so forth.
Exactly which instances of the reflection scheme are actually provable
in the system? Löb’s Theorem gives a precise answer to this
question (assuming that \(\Prov_F (x)\)
satisfies the derivability conditions):
Löb’s Theorem

Let \(A\) be any sentence of the language of \(F\). Then: \(F
\vdash\Prov_F (\ulcorner A\urcorner) \rightarrow A\) if, and only if,
\(F \vdash A.\)
Hence, the instances of soundness (reflection principle) provable in a
system are exactly the ones which concern sentences which are
themselves provable in the system. As a consequence, this also settles
Henkin’s original problem: assuming that the arithmetized
provability predicate is again “normal” (i.e., satisfies
Löb’s derivability conditions), all sentences
“asserting their own provability” are provable.
Actually, Löb’s theorem can be proved quite quickly as a
consequence of the second incompleteness theorem. Kreisel has also
noted that, in the opposite direction, the second incompleteness
theorem can also be easily derived as a consequence of
Löb’s theorem.
The tenth on Hilbert’s famous list of important open problem in
mathematics from 1900 asks for a decision method for the so-called
Diophantine equations. Despite the unfamiliar term
“Diophantine,” what is at issue here is truly elementary.
Consider any equation with one or more variables and with integer
coefficients, which involves only addition and multiplication, such as
\(x^2 + y^2 = 2\), or \(3x^2 + 5y^2 + 2xy = 0\). If real-number
solutions are sought, one usually speaks simply about an
“equation”. However, in number theory, typically a
solution is sought consisting only of integers. That makes a great
difference. The former of the above equations has infinitely many
solutions among real numbers, but only four among integers. The
equation \(x^2 + y^2 = 3\) also has infinitely many real solutions but
no integer solutions. When the focus is on the integer solutions, one
talks about “Diophantine equations” (after the ancient
number theorist Diophantus of Alexandria). 
For a positive solution of Hilbert’s tenth problem, it would
have sufficed to present a particular concrete method which would have
intuitively been a “mechanical” decision method. However,
Turing’s pioneering analysis of the notion of decision method
brought into focus the possibility of a negative solution. Beginning
in the early 1950s, Julia Robinson and Martin Davis worked on this
problem, later joined by Hilary Putnam. As a result of their
collaboration, the first important result in this direction was
achieved. Call an equation “an exponential Diophantine
equation” if it involves also exponentiation, as well as
addition and multiplication (that is, one can have both constants and
variables as exponents); naturally, the focus is still in the integer
solutions. Davis, Putnam, and Robinson (1961), showed that the problem
of solvability of exponential Diophantine equations is undecidable. In
1970, Yuri Matiyasevich added the final missing piece, and
demonstrated that the problem of the solvability of Diophantine
equations is undecidable. Hence the overall result is often called
MRDP Theorem (for an exposition, see, e.g., Davis 1973; Matiyasevich
1993).
The essential technical achievement was that all semi-decidable
(recursively enumerable) sets can be given a Diophantine
representation, i.e., they can be represented by a simple formula of
the form \(\exists x_1 \ldots \exists x_n (s = t)\), where \((s = t)\)
is a Diophantine equation. More exactly, for any given recursively
enumerable set \(S\), there is a Diophantine equation \((s(y, x_1 ,
\ldots ,x_n) = t(y, x_1 , \ldots ,x_n))\) such that \(\boldsymbol{n}
\in S\) if and only if \(\exists x_1 \ldots \exists x_n
(s(\underline{n}, x_1 , \ldots ,x_n) = t(\underline{n}, x_1 , \ldots
,x_n))\).
As there are semi-decidable (recursively enumerable) sets which are
not decidable (recursive), the general conclusion follows immediately:
MRDP Theorem

There is no general method for deciding whether or not a given
Diophantine equation has a solution.
This also provides an elegant variant of the incompleteness theorems
dealing with Diophantine equations:
Corollary

For any 1-consistent axiomatizable formal system \(F\) there are
Diophantine equations which have no solutions but cannot be proved in
\(F\) to have no solutions.
(The question of avoiding the requirement of 1-consistency here is
tricky; see Dyson, Jones and Shepherson 1982.)
The undecidable sentences provided by Gödel’s proofs are
(if written out) extremely complicated formulas with no intuitive
significance, construed only for the purposes of the incompleteness
proofs. The question then arises whether there are any simple and
natural mathematical statements which are likewise undecidable in
chosen basic theories, e.g., in PA. There are now
various specific statements with clear mathematical content which are
known to be undecidable in some standard theories (though, just how
natural even these are has been disputed; see Feferman 1989b). Some
well known, natural examples are listed below, beginning with some
quite natural mathematical statements which are independent of
PA, and proceeding to more and more powerful
theories. Sometimes such results are called variants of
Gödel’s theorem, or their proofs of independence
alternative proofs of Gödel’s theorem, but this is
misleading: interesting as they may be, they don’t have the
generality of Gödel’s theorems proper, but only provide
statements independent of a particular theory.
It is often stated that before the celebrated Paris-Harrington theorem
(see below), no such natural independent mathematical statements were
known. This is not, however, strictly speaking, correct. Already much
earlier, around 1935, Gerhard Gentzen (see the entry on the
 development of proof theory)
 had provided such a statement. It is very natural to generalize the
idea of induction from the domain of natural numbers to the domain of
ordinal numbers. In set theory, such generalizations are called
principles of transfinite induction. Though some constructivists may
be sceptical about the legitimacy of full set theory, there are
limited and more concrete cases of transfinite induction (only dealing
with some well-defined classes of countable ordinals) that are
perfectly acceptable even from the constructivist or intuitionist
viewpoint. One important case is the principle of transfinite
induction up to the ordinal called \(\varepsilon_0\). Gentzen
showed that the consistency of PA can be proved if
this transfinite induction principle is assumed. Therefore, because of
the second incompleteness theorem, the principle itself cannot be
provable in PA (Gentzen 1936).
Ramsey’s theorem is a result in infinitary combinatorics,
established by Frank Ramsey (1930), and deals with possibilities of
“colouring” for certain graphs. Jeff Paris and Leo
Harrington formulated a finitary variant of Ramsey’s theorem,
and showed that it is not provable in PA (Paris &
Harrington 1977). This provides a quite natural statement of finite
combinatorics which is independent of PA. Perhaps an
even cleaner example is Goodstein’s theorem, due to Reuben
Goodstein (1944), which is purely number theoretic in nature. First
one defines a certain natural class of sequences of natural numbers,
now called “Goodstein sequences”. The theorem states that
every Goodstein sequence eventually terminates at 0. Goodstein’s
theorem is certainly a natural mathematical statement, for it was
formulated and proved (obviously by proof methods that go beyond
PA) by Goodstein long before (that is, in 1944) it
was shown, in 1982, that the theorem is not provable in
PA (Kirby & Paris 1982). 
Moving now to stronger theories beyond PA, one can
mention, for example, Kruskal’s Theorem. This is a theorem which
concerns certain orderings of finite trees (Kruskal 1960). Harvey
Friedman showed that this theorem is unprovable even in subsystems of
second-order arithmetic much stronger than PA (see
Simpson 1985). In particular, it is not provable in any theory which
is predicatively justified (under a widely accepted explication of
“predicative”, cf. the section on predicativism in the
entry on the
 philosophy of mathematics).
There are some concrete examples of mathematical statements undecided
even in stronger theories which come from the so-called descriptive
set theory. This field of mathematics is related to topology and was
initiated by the French semi-intuitionists (Lebesgue, Baire, Borel;
see the section on descriptive set theory, etc., in the entry on
 intuitionism in the philosophy of mathematics).
 It studies sets which possess relatively simple definitions (in
contradistinction to the ideas of arbitrary sets and various higher
power-sets, which the semi-intuitionists rejected as meaningless)
called projective or analytic sets. Classically these were defined as
the sets that can be built up from a countable intersection of open
sets by taking continuous images and complements finitely many times;
they coincide with the sets which are definable in the language of
P\(^2\). In particular, the so-called Borel sets can
be simply defined both by a formula of the form \(\exists XA(x)\) and
by a formula of the form \(\forall XB(x)\), where \(A\) and \(B\) do
not contain any set variables (in logician’s terminology, Borel
sets are the \(\Delta^{1}_1\) sets). A Borel function is defined
analogously (see, e.g., Martin 1977).
Harvey Friedman has established the following theorem: roughly, if
\(S\) is a Borel set, then there exists a Borel function \(f\)
such that the graph of \(f\) is either included in or disjoint from
\(S\). Friedman showed that this simple-sounding theorem is not
provable even in full second-order arithmetic
P\(^2\), but proving it necessarily requires
the full power of ZFC (see Simpson 1999: 23).
Further, it was a traditional question of descriptive set theory (a
question which can be formulated in the language of second order
arithmetic) whether all projective sets (see above) are Lebesque
measurable. This remained an open problem for many decades, and for a
good reason: it turned out that the statement is independent even of
the full ZFC set theory (see Solovay 1970). Only by
postulating the existence of some extremely large cardinals (so-called
Woodin cardinals) can the hypothesis that all projective sets are
Lebesque measurable be proved (this was achieved as a consequence of
their work on so-called projective determinacy by Woodin, Martin and
Steel; see Woodin 1988; Martin & Steel 1988, 1989). 
Sometimes Paul Cohen’s celebrated result that the Continuum
Hypothesis (CH) is independent of ZFC (Cohen 1963,
1964; see the entry on
 independence and large cardinals).
 However, this case is very different. In all the above independence
results the relevant statements are still theorems of mathematics,
taken as shown to be true (the last case, which requires large
cardinal axioms that go beyond ZFC, is more
controversial; still, at least many set-theoreticians find such axioms
plausible). And with the first incompleteness theorem itself, the
truth of the unprovable statement easily follows, given that the
assumption of the consistency of the system is indeed correct.
However, in the case of Cohen’s result, there is absolutely no
indication whether CH should be considered true, false, or perhaps
lacking a truth-value. 
Gödel’s results were certainly surprising, but some sort of
incompleteness phenomenon was not totally unexpected. The possibility
of incompleteness in the context of set theory was discussed by
Bernays and Tarski already in 1928, and von Neumann, in contrast to
the dominant spirit in Hilbert’s program, had considered it
possible that logic and mathematics were not decidable. Gödel
himself had mentioned the possibility of an undecidable problem
concerning real numbers in his thesis in 1929 (see Dawson 1985).
Hilbert (1928), on the other hand, had assumed that Peano Arithmetic
and other standard theories were complete. Apparently Gödel was
also impressed by Brouwer, who in his lecture in Vienna in 1928 had
suggested that mathematics is inexhaustible and cannot be completely
formalized (see Wang 1987, 84; and the section on Brouwer’s view
of the formalist program in the entry on
 the development of intuitionistic logic).
Be that as it may, it seems that Gödel actually arrived at the
first exact observations about incompleteness via a different route,
during his attempts to contribute to Hilbert’s program,
and not to undermine it (see Dawson 1997: Ch. IV). Namely, in 1930,
Gödel made an effort to advance Hilbert’s program by
attempting to prove the consistency of analysis (or, second-order
arithmetic) with the resources of arithmetic, and thus reduce the
consistency of the former to the consistency of the latter. In his
attempted proof, he needed the notion of truth. Gödel soon faced
various paradoxes (such as the Liar paradox), and had to conclude that
arithmetical truth cannot be defined in arithmetic. Hence, Gödel
first arrived at a version of the undefinability of truth theorem,
usually associated with Tarski (cf. Murawski 1998). This also easily
yields a weak version of the incompleteness result: the set of
sentences provable in arithmetic can be defined in the language of
arithmetic, but the set of true arithmetical sentences cannot;
therefore the two cannot coincide. Moreover, under the assumption that
all provable sentences are true, it follows that there must be true
sentences which are not provable. This approach, though, does not
exhibit any particular such sentence.
However, the intellectual environment of Gödel was that of the
Vienna Circle with its radically anti-metaphysical attitude. In
particular, even the notion of truth was considered as suspicious or
even nonsensical at the time, at least by some logical positivists
(e.g., Neurath, Hempel). Therefore, Gödel worked hard to
eliminate any appeal to the notion of truth and attempted to do
without it. He therefore introduced the notion of \(\omega\)-consistency,
which can be defined rigorously and purely syntactically. This led to
the incompleteness theorems in the form that they are now known.
As to the Diagonalization Lemma, actually Gödel himself
originally demonstrated only a special case of it, that is, only for
the provability predicate. The general lemma was apparently first
discovered by Carnap 1934 (see Gödel 1934, 1935). Still more
general versions, for formulas with free variables, were presented in
Ehrenfeucht & Feferman 1960 and Montague 1962 (see Smoryński
1981).
The reception of Gödel’s results was mixed. Some important
figures in the field of logic and the foundations of mathematics quite
quickly assimilated the results and understood their relevance, but
there was also quite a lot of misunderstanding and resistance (for
detailed accounts of the reception, see Dawson 1985; Mancosu
1999).
Gödel revealed his results to Carnap in Vienna on 26 August 1930,
and announced his result (the first theorem) in a casual discussion
remark in the famous Königsberg Conference on September 7, 1930.
John von Neumann, who was in the audience and was at the time working
in the context of Hilbert’s program, immediately understood the
great importance of the result. On 20 November he wrote a letter to
Gödel on a “remarkable” corollary of
Gödel’s result he had discovered: the unprovability of
consistency (the second theorem). Meanwhile Gödel himself,
however, had found the same idea and had already sent the final
version of his article, which now contained also a statement of the
second incompleteness theorem, for publication. The article was
published in January 1931 (Gödel 1931; helpful introductions to
Gödel’s original paper are Kleene 1986 and Zach 2005). The
word quickly started to spread of these results which apparently had
great importance for the foundations of mathematics—though views
on what really was the moral varied. Paul Bernays, perhaps the most
important collaborator of Hilbert, showed great interest in the
results, though he first had difficulties in understanding them
properly. His active correspondence with Gödel also shows that
Gödel was already at the time fully aware of the undefinability
of truth.
As Gödel’s original approach focused on his specific though
very comprehensive system P and its (primitive
recursive) extensions, some doubted the generality of
Gödel’s results. Alonzo Church, for example, in a letter to
Gödel in July 1932, suggested that Gödel’s results
would not apply to his system of \(\lambda\)-conversion (the system was
later proved to be inconsistent by Kleene and Rosser). Gödel was
anxious to generalize his discoveries, and extended the results to a
wider class of systems in papers in 1932 and 1934. He also suggested
that his methods would be applicable to standard systems of set theory
(however, it was only after the satisfactory characterization of
decidability and the Church-Turing thesis a few years later that it
was possible to give a fully general formulation of the incompleteness
theorems (see above); this was first done in Kleene 1936). The eminent
set-theorist Ernst Zermelo directed some rather harsh criticism
towards Gödel’s work, but the two also corresponded on the
topic. Zermelo seems to have had serious difficulties in understanding
the relevant concepts and results.
In March 1933, Gödel received a letter from Paul Finsler, from
Zürich, who suggested that he had already earlier (in Finsler
1926) done closely related work but with a more general relevance.
Gödel replied that Finsler’s system was not really defined
at all. In his heated response, Finsler claimed that it was not
necessary to be able to study a system for it to be sharply defined,
and that there was no difference in principle between his ideas and
Gödel’s. In retrospect, it is quite clear that the
approaches of Finsler and Gödel were very different: for
Gödel’s work, the notion of formalized system was
essential, whereas Finsler rejected the very notion as artificially
restrictive. In fact, it is far from clear that Finsler’s ideas
make any sense—whatever vague analogies there may be between
them and Gödel’s proof.
On the other hand, it is fair to say that Emil Post had in some
respects anticipated Gödel’s discoveries. He obtained
abstract versions of incompleteness results apparently already in
1922. In particular, he observed that his methods would provide a
statement undecidable in Principia Mathematica. These results
were, however, based on Post’s own version of the
“Church-Turing thesis”, with which he was dissatisfied,
and his work was left unpublished. It was reported much later in (Post
1941). 
The correctness of Gödel’s theorems remained the subject of
lively debate throughout the 1930s (see Dawson 1985). In 1939, Hilbert
and Bernays’ second volume of Die Grundlagen der
Mathematik appeared, including a detailed proof of the second
incompleteness theorem. Thereafter, serious opposition to
Gödel’s conclusions disappeared at least among those who
were working actively in mathematical logic and the foundations of
mathematics. However, in more philosophical circles, some resistance
remained. Most famously, Wittgenstein made some critical remarks
concerning Gödel’s theorem in his posthumously published
Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics. The dominant initial
reaction was that Wittgenstein simply failed to understand the result.
More charitable interpretations have emerged, and the debate is still
very much alive (see the section on Gödel and undecidable
propositions in the entry on
 Wittgenstein’s philosophy of mathematics).
Of the various fields of philosophy, Gödel’s theorems are
obviously most immediately relevant for the philosophy of mathematics.
To begin with, they pose, at least prima facie, serious
problems for Hilbert’s program (this issue is discussed in some
detail in the section on the impact of incompleteness in the entry on
 Hilbert’s Program).
 Then again, they have important consequences for intuitionism
(see the entry on
 intuitionism in the philosophy of mathematics)
 (see also Gödel 1933, 1941; Raatikainen 2005).
There has been some dispute on the issue as to whether
Gödel’s theorems conclusively refute logicism (see
the entry on
 logicism).
 Henkin (1962) and Musgrave (1977), for example, argue it does;
Sternfeld (1976) and Rodríguez-Consuegra (1993) disagree (see
also Hellman 1981; Raatikainen 2005).
Gödel himself developed an argument against the conventionalist
philosophy of mathematics of logical positivism, and of Carnap’s
in particular, based on the incompleteness results (Gödel
1953/9). It is discussed in Goldfarb and Ricketts 1992; Ricketts 1995;
Goldfarb 1995; Crocco 2003; Awodey & Carus 2003, 2004; Tennant
2008. 
One can also give more general epistemological interpretations of
Gödel’s theorems. Quine and Ullian (1978), for example,
consider the traditional philosophical picture that all truths could
be proved by self-evident steps from self-evident truths and
observation. They then point out that even the truths of elementary
number theory are presumably not in general derivable by self-evident
steps from self-evident truths (Quine & Ullian 1978: 64–65.)
Hilary Putnam (1975) in turn submits that, under a certain natural
understanding of “analytic”, there must be, by
Gödel’s theorems, synthetic truths in mathematics. In fact,
Gödel himself made remarks in a very similar spirit that even the
theory of integers is demonstrably non-analytic (Gödel 1944).
There have been repeated attempts to apply Gödel’s theorems
to demonstrate that the powers of the human mind outrun any mechanism
or formal system. Such a Gödelian argument against mechanism was
considered, if only in order to refute it, already by Turing in the
late 1940s (see Piccinini 2003). An unqualified anti-mechanist
conclusion was drawn from the incompleteness theorems in a widely read
popular exposition, Gödel’s Theorem, by Nagel and
Newman (1958). Shortly afterwards, J.R. Lucas (1961) famously
proclaimed that Gödel’s incompleteness theorem
proves that Mechanism is false, that is, that minds cannot be
explained as machines. 
He stated that 
given any machine which is consistent and capable of doing simple
arithmetic, there is a formula it is incapable of producing as being
true … but which we can see to be true.
More recently, very similar claims have been put forward by Roger
Penrose (1989, 1994). John Searle (1997) has joined the discussion and
partly defended Penrose against his critics. Crispin Wright (1994,
1995) has endorsed related ideas from an intuitionistic point of view
(for criticism, see Detlefsen 1995). They all insist that
Gödel’s theorems imply that the human mind infinitely
surpasses the power of any finite machine or formal system.
These Gödelian anti-mechanist arguments are, however,
problematic, and there is wide consensus that they fail. The standard
response to this argument goes along the following lines (this
objection goes back to Putnam 1960; see also Boolos 1968, Shapiro
1998): The argument assumes that for any formalized system, or a
finite machine, there exists the Gödel sentence which is
unprovable in that system, but which the human mind can see to be
true. Yet Gödel’s theorem has in reality a conditional
form, and the alleged truth of the Gödel sentence of a system
depends on the assumption of the consistency of the system. The
anti-mechanist’s argument thus also requires that the human mind
can always see whether or not a given formalized theory is consistent.
However, this is highly implausible (cf. Davis 1990). Lucas, Penrose
and others have attempted to reply to such criticism (see, e.g., Lucas
1996; Penrose 1995, 1997). For detailed criticism of Penrose, see
Boolos 1990; Davis 1990, 1993; Feferman 1995; Lindström 2001;
Pudlák 1999; Shapiro 2003; many of these considerations are
also relevant for what Lucas says).
Interestingly, Gödel himself also presented an anti-mechanist
argument although it was more cautious and only published posthumously
(in his Collected Works, Vol. III, in 1995). That is, in his
1951 Gibbs lecture, Gödel drew the following disjunctive
conclusion from the incompleteness theorems: 
either … the human mind (even within the realm of pure
mathematics) infinitely surpasses the power of any finite machine, or
else there exist absolutely unsolvable diophantine problems. 
Gödel speaks about this statement as a “mathematically
established fact” (Gödel 1951; for more discussion on
Gödel’s disjunctive claim, see, e.g., Shapiro 1998).
According to Gödel, the second alternative 
seems to disprove the view that mathematics is only our own creation
… that mathematical objects and facts … exist
objectively and independently of our mental acts and decisions. 
Gödel was nonetheless inclined to deny the possibility of
absolutely unsolvable problems, and although he did believe in
mathematical Platonism, his reasons for this conviction were
different, and he did not maintain that the incompleteness theorems
alone establish Platonism. Thus Gödel believed in the first
disjunct, that the human mind infinitely surpasses the power of any
finite machine. Still, this conclusion of Gödel follows, as
Gödel himself clearly explains, only if one denies, as does
Gödel, the possibility of humanly unsolvable problems. It is not
a necessary consequence of incompleteness theorems.
Now Gödel was, unlike the later advocates of the so-called
Gödelian anti-mechanist argument, sensitive enough to admit that
both mechanism and the alternative that there are humanly absolutely
unsolvable problems are consistent with his incompleteness theorems.
His fundamental reasons for disliking the latter alternative are much
more philosophical. Gödel thought in a somewhat Kantian way that
human reason would be fatally irrational if it asked questions it
could not answer (for critical discussion, see Kreisel 1967; Boolos
1995; Raatikainen 2005).
As a reaction to Lucas’ argument, but before the publication of
Gödel’s Gibbs Lecture, Paul Benacerraf (1967) put forward
more qualified conclusions that interestingly resemble some ideas of
Gödel. He argued that it is consistent with all the facts that I
am indeed a Turing machine, but that I cannot ascertain which one. For
some critical discussion, see Chihara 1972 and Hanson 1971.
Sometimes quite fantastic conclusions are drawn from
Gödel’s theorems. It has been even suggested that
Gödel’s theorems, if not exactly prove, at least give
strong support for mysticism or the existence of God. These
interpretations seem to assume one or more misunderstandings which
have already been discussed above: it is either assumed that
Gödel provided an absolutely unprovable sentence, or that
Gödel’s theorems imply Platonism, or anti-mechanism, or
both.

incompleteness theorems, see Raatikainen 2005 and Franzén
