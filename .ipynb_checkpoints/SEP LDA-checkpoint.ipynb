      "their cause by eliminating the possibility of contradictory evidence.\n",
      "It has thus become what Popper terms “reinforced\n",
      "dogmatism” (1963: 334). \n",
      "These factors combined to make Popper take falsifiability as\n",
      "his criterion for demarcating science from non-science: if a theory is\n",
      "incompatible with possible empirical observations it is scientific;\n",
      "conversely, a theory which is compatible with all such observations,\n",
      "either because, as in the case of Marxism, it has been modified solely\n",
      "to accommodate such observations, or because, as in the case of\n",
      "psychoanalytic theories, it is consistent with all possible\n",
      "observations, is unscientific. However, Popper is not a positivist and\n",
      "acknowledges that unscientific theories may be enlightening and that\n",
      "even purely mythogenic explanations have performed a valuable function\n",
      "in the past in expediting our understanding of the nature of\n",
      "reality. \n",

      "demarcation, i.e., of distinguishing between science and what he terms\n",
      "“non-science” (e.g., logic, metaphysics, psychoanalysis,\n",
      "and Adler’s individual psychology). Popper is unusual amongst\n",
      "contemporary philosophers in that he accepts the validity of\n",

      "observation, as the initial step in the formation of theories, is\n",
      "completely misguided: all observation is selective and theory-laden\n",

      "from non-science on the basis of its inductive methodology. In\n",
      "contradistinction to this, Popper holds that there is no unique\n",
      "methodology specific to science; rather, science, like virtually every\n",
      "other organic activity, consists largely of problem-solving. \n",
      "Popper accordingly rejects the view that induction is the\n",
      "characteristic method of scientific investigation and inference,\n",
      "substituting falsifiability in its place. It is easy, he\n",
      "argues, to obtain evidence in favour of virtually any theory, and he\n",
      "consequently holds that such “corroboration”, as he terms\n",
      "it, should count scientifically only if it is the positive result of a\n",
      "genuinely “risky” prediction, which might conceivably have\n",
      "been false. In a critical sense, Popper’s theory of demarcation\n",
      "is based upon his perception of the asymmetry which, at the level of\n",
      "logic, holds between verification and falsification: it is logically\n",
      "impossible to verify a universal proposition by reference to\n",
      "experience (as Hume saw clearly), but a single genuine\n",
      "counter-instance falsifies the corresponding universal law. In a word,\n",
      "an exception, far from “proving” a rule, conclusively\n",
      "refutes it. \n",
      "Every genuine scientific theory then, in Popper’s view, is\n",
      "prohibitive, because the theories of natural science take the\n",
      "form of universal statements. “All As are\n",
      "X” is equivalent to “No A is\n",
      "not-X” which is falsified if “Some A is\n",
      "not-X” turns out to be true. For example, the law of\n",
      "the conservation of energy can be expressed as “There is no\n",
      "perpetual motion machine”. \n",
      "However, the universality of such laws, he argues, does rule out the\n",
      "possibility of their verification. Thus, a theory that has withstood\n",
      "rigorous testing should be deemed to have received a high measure of\n",
      "corroboration. and may be retained provisionally as the best available\n",
      "theory until it is finally falsified and/or is superseded by a better\n",
      "theory. \n",
      "Popper stresses in particular that there is no unique way, no single\n",
      "method such as induction, which functions as the route to scientific\n",
      "theory, and approvingly cites Einstein on that point: \n",
      "There is no logical path leading to [the highly universal laws of\n",
      "science]. They can only be reached by intuition, based upon something\n",
      "like an intellectual love of the objects of experience. (2002:\n",
      "8–9) \n",
      "Science, in Popper’s view, starts with problems rather than with\n",
      "observations—it is, indeed, precisely in the context of\n",
      "grappling with a problem that the scientist makes observations in the\n",
      "first instance: his observations are selectively designed to test the\n",
      "extent to which a given theory functions as a satisfactory solution to\n",
      "a given problem. \n",
      "On this criterion of demarcation physics, chemistry, and\n",
      "(non-introspective) psychology, amongst others, are classified as\n",
      "sciences, psychoanalysis is a pre-science and astrology and phrenology\n",
      "are pseudo-sciences. \n",
      "Popper draws a clear distinction between the logic of\n",
      "falsifiability and its applied methodology. The logic of his\n",
      "theory is utterly simple: a universal statement is falsified by a\n",
      "single genuine counter-instance. Methodologically, however, the\n",
      "situation is complex: decisions about whether to accept an apparently\n",
      "falsifying observation as an actual falsification can be problematic,\n",
      "as observational bias and measurement error, for example, can yield\n",
      "results which are only apparently incompatible with the theory under\n",
      "scrutiny. \n",
      "Thus, while advocating falsifiability as the criterion of demarcation\n",
      "for science, Popper explicitly allows for the fact that in practice a\n",
      "single conflicting or counter-instance is never sufficient\n",
      "methodologically for falsification, and that scientific theories are\n",
      "often retained even though much of the available evidence conflicts\n",
      "with them, or is anomalous with respect to them. \n",
      "In this connection, in the Logic of Scientific Discovery\n",
      "Popper introduces the technical concept of a “basic\n",
      "statement” or “basic proposition”, which he defines\n",
      "as a statement which can serve as a premise in an empirical\n",
      "falsification and which takes the singular existential form\n",
      "“There is an X at Y”. Basic statements\n",
      "are important because they can formally contradict universal\n",
      "statements, and accordingly play the role of potential falsifiers. To\n",
      "take an example, the (putative) basic statement “In space-time\n",
      "region k there is an apparatus which is a perpetual motion\n",
      "machine” contradicts the law of the conservation of energy, and\n",
      "would, if true, falsify it (2002: 48). Accordingly, Popper holds that\n",
      "basic statements are objective and are governed by two requirements:\n",
      "(a) the formal, that they must be both singular and\n",
      "existential and (b) the material, that they must be\n",
      "intersubjectively testable. \n",
      "In essence, basic statements are for Popper logical constructs which\n",
      "embrace and include ‘observation statements’, but for\n",
      "methodological reasons he seeks to avoid that terminology, as it\n",
      "suggests that they are derived directly from, and known by, experience\n",
      "(2002: 12, footnote 2), which would conflate them with the\n",
      "“protocol” statements of logical positivism and\n",
      "reintroduce the empiricist idea that certain kinds of experiential\n",
      "reports are incorrigible. The “objectivity” requirement in\n",
      "Popper’s account of basic statements, by contrast, amounts to a\n",
      "rejection of the view that the truth of scientific statements can ever\n",
      "be reduced to individual or collective human experience. (2002:\n",
      "25). \n",
      "Popper therefore argues that there are no statements in science which\n",
      "cannot be interrogated: basic statements, which are used to test the\n",
      "universal theories of science, must themselves be inter-subjectively\n",
      "testable and are therefore open to the possibility of refutation. He\n",
      "acknowledges that this seems to present a practical difficulty, in\n",
      "that it appears to suggest that testability must occur ad\n",
      "infinitum, which he acknowledges is an operational absurdity:\n",
      "sooner or later all testing must come to an end. Where testing ends,\n",

      "principle, whether the basic statements which are its potential\n",
      "falsifiers are actually true or false. But how can this be known, if\n",
      "basic statements cannot be justified by experience? As we have seen,\n",
